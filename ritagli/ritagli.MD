Due to this current plague, all ruck marches, and field exercises have been canceled, at least here in Finland. So we decided to launch our very own Varustelekas Remote Military March (VRMM). See the event on Facebook. Plain and simple, each individual warrior executes their march according to our guidelines and shares the fun on social media. This way we can keep our rucking condition in top shape and bring some good vibes to these grim times.

		A PUTATIVE JUVENILE SPECIMEN OF   EUSAUROSPHARGIS DALSASSOI   FROM THE  ANISIAN (MIDDLE TRIASSIC) OF PIZ DA PERES (DOLOMITES, NORTHERN ITALY) 
							| RIVISTA ITALIANA DI PALEONTOLOGIA E STRATIGRAFIA 
			**](https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/RIPS/article/view/13222)

The partial skeleton of a small tetrapod, collected from the lower Buchenstein Formation (uppermost Illyrian, Anisian Middle Triassic) of Piz da Peres (Northern Dolomites, Italy) is described. Incomplete ossification of some bones indicate that the specimen is a juvenile. Its absolute size and proportions, along with several skeletal structures show striking similarities with a juvenile specimen of Eusaurosphargis dalsassoi from the slightly younger Prosanto Formation (Switzerland), a taxon known also from the Anisian/Ladinian Besano Formation (Italy and Switzerland). The finding may suggest that during the middle-late Anisian the basins of the Northern Dolomites, of the Besano Formation and Prosanto Formation shared not only several taxa of fishes but also the emerged lands nearby had a similar reptilian fauna.

The isolation that most of the civilized world has been subjected to, during the past few weeks, has produced a number of nasty effects, first and foremost on our economies, but it has also had a few positive ones. One of them is, at least in my case, an urge to use the extra time I have in my hands in a creative way.
