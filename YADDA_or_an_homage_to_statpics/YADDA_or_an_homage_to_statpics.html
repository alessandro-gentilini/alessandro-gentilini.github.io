  	<h1>YADDA, or an homage to <a href="http://statpics.blogspot.com">Statpics</a></h1>
  	<p>I am a follower of the <a href="http://statpics.blogspot.com">Statpics</a> blog
  		and one of my favourite category of posts is 
  		<a href="http://statpics.blogspot.com/search/label/YADDA">
  		YADDA	
  		</a> which means <i>Yet Another Door Distribution Again</i>.
  	</p>
  	<p>I was in the Rifugio Giogo Lungo (<a href="http://www.lenkl.com/en/home">Lenkjöchlhütte</a>
  		in German) and I took this pictures of the mess hall: the little windows is where the cook
  		pass the dishes to the waiter, the waiter waits in front of it on a wooden floor and
  		you can see the two footprint distribution where the paintings weared out.
