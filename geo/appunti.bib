	abstract = {In this guide, we present a reading list to serve as a concise introduction to Bayesian data analysis. The introduction is geared toward reviewers, editors, and interested researchers who are new to Bayesian statistics. We provide commentary for eight recommended sources, which together cover the theoretical and practical cornerstones of Bayesian statistics in psychology and related sciences. The resources are presented in an incremental order, starting with theoretical foundations and moving on to applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment. After consulting our guide, the reader should understand how and why Bayesian methods work, and feel able to evaluate their use in the behavioral and social sciences.},

	abstract = {The NW Iberian margin is a hyperextended continental margin, formed during the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean, where a subsequent partial tectonic inversion has undergone during the Alpine Orogeny. This succession of tectonic episodes determines the magnetic signature of the margin. The Spanish Exclusive Economic Zone Project has carried out seven one-month cruises between 2001 and 2009. To extend and densify the spatial coverage, we have used data from the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map. Here, we describe the methodology used for the acquisition and data processing of the magnetic ﬁeld data. The use of diverse instrumentation, a non-complete external ﬁeld’s cancelation, and the use of diﬀerent magnetic core ﬁeld models, contributed to the total error budget. To reduce it, we have used a leveling algorithm which minimizes all these contributions. Finally, a statistical analysis was applied using crossover residuals, showing a resolution better than 28 nT.},

	abstract = {Digital algorithms for robust detection of phase arrivals in the presence of stationary and nonstationary noise have a long history in seismology and have been exploited primarily to reduce the amount of data recorded by data logging systems to manageable levels. In the present era of inexpensive digital storage, however, such algorithms are increasingly being used to flag signal segments in continuously recorded digital data streams for subsequent processing by automatic and/or expert interpretation systems. In the course of our development of an automated, near-real-time, waveform correlation event-detection and location system (WCEDS), we have surveyed the abilities of such algorithms to enhance seismic phase arrivals in teleseismic data streams. Specifically, we have considered envelopes generated by energy transient (STA/LTA), Z-statistic, frequency transient, and polarization algorithms. The WCEDS system requires a set of input data streams that have a smooth, low-amplitude response to background noise and seismic coda and that contain peaks at times corresponding to phase arrivals. The algorithm used to generate these input streams from raw seismograms must perform well under a wide range of source, path, receiver, and noise scenarios. Present computational capabilities allow the application of considerably more robust algorithms than have been historically used in real time. However, highly complex calculations can still be computationally prohibitive for current workstations when the number of data streams become large. While no algorithm was clearly optimal under all source, receiver, path, and noise conditions tested, an STA/LTA algorithm incorporating adaptive window lengths controlled by nonstationary seismogram spectral characteristics was found to provide an output that best met the requirements of a global correlation-based event-detection and location system.},

	abstract = {The goal of geophysicalinversionis to make quantitative inferences about the Earth from remote observations. Because the observations are finite in number and subject to uncertainty, these inferencesare inherently probabilistic. A key step is to define what it means for an Earth model to fit the data. This requires estimation of the uncertaintiesin the data, both thosedue to random noise and thosedue to theoreticalerrors. But the set of modelsthat fit the data usually containsunrealisticmodels;i.e., modelsthat violate our a priori prejudices,other data, or theoreticalconsiderations.One strategyfor eliminatingsuchunreasonable modelsis to definean a priori probability density on the spaceof models,then use Bayestheoremto combinethis probability with the data misfit function into a final a posterioriprobability densityreflectingboth data fit and model reasonableness. We showhere a casestudy of the applicationof the Bayesianstrategyto inversion of surfaceseismicfield data. Assumingthat all uncertaintiescan be describedby multidimensionalGaussianprobability densities,we incorporateinto the calculation information about ambient noise,discretizationerrors, theoreticalerrors, and a priori information about the set of layered Earth modelsderived from in situ petrophysical measurements.The result is a probability density on the spaceof modelsthat takes into accountall of this information. Inferenceson modelparameterscanbe derivedby integrationof this function. We begin by estimatingthe parametersof the Gaussian probability densitiesassumedto describethe data and model uncertainties. These are combinedvia Bayes theorem. The a posteriori probability is then optimized via a nonlinear conjugategradient procedureto find the maximum a posteriori model. Uncertainty analysisis performedby making a Gaussianapproximationof the a posteriori distribution about this peak model. We presentthe resultsof this analysis in three different forms: the maximum a posteriori model bracketedby one standard deviation error bars, pseudo-randomsimulationsof the a posteriori probability (showingthe rangeof typicalsubsurfacme odels),andmarginalsof this probability at selecteddepths in the subsurface. The models we compute are consistentboth with the surfaceseismicdata and the boreholemeasurementse, venthoughthe latter are well below the resolutionof the former. We alsocontrast the Bayesianmaximum a posteriorimodel with the Occammodel, which is the smoothestmodel that fits the surface seismic data alone.},

	abstract = {Background: Density estimation is a key issue in wildlife management but is particularly challenging and labourintensive for elusive species. Recently developed approaches based on remotely collected data and capture-recapture models, though representing a valid alternative to more traditional methods, have found little application to species with limited morphological variation. We implemented a camera trap capture-recapture study to survey wolf packs in a 560-km2 area of Central Italy. Individual recognition of focal animals (alpha) in the packs was possible by relying on morphological and behavioural traits and was validated by non-invasive genotyping and inter-observer agreement tests. Two types (Bayesian and likelihood-based) of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) models were fitted on wolf pack capture histories, thus obtaining an estimation of pack density in the area.
Results: In two sessions of camera trapping surveys (2014 and 2015), we detected a maximum of 12 wolf packs. A Bayesian model implementing a half-normal detection function without a trap-specific response provided the most robust result, corresponding to a density of 1.21 ± 0.27 packs/100 km2 in 2015. Average pack size varied from 3.40 (summer 2014, excluding pups and lone-transient wolves) to 4.17 (late winter-spring 2015, excluding lone-transient wolves).
Conclusions: We applied for the first time a camera-based SCR approach in wolves, providing the first robust estimate of wolf pack density for an area of Italy. We showed that this method is applicable to wolves under the following conditions: i) the existence of sufficient phenotypic/behavioural variation and the recognition of focal individuals (i.e. alpha, verified by non-invasive genotyping); ii) the investigated area is sufficiently large to include a minimum number of packs (ideally 10); iii) a pilot study is carried out to pursue an adequate sampling design and to train operators on individual wolf recognition. We believe that replicating this approach in other areas can allow for an assessment of density variation across the wolf range and would provide a reliable reference parameter for ecological studies.},

	abstract = {A natural, well-preserved mummy belonging to a 35-40 years old male was found in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Popoli, Abruzzo region, central Italy. His fine clothes and burial location suggested that he was of high social status and had an important role in the church community. Most likely, he was a nobleman and a member of the Holy Trinity congregation. Two artifacts, a medallion and a relic of Saint Philomena, helped to date back the individual’s time of death to the early 1800’s. To conduct scientific analyses the body was secured to a cardboard layer by a plastic film and submitted to external examination, digital radiology, and computed tomography scanning, as well as histologic examination of samples obtained by video endoscopy. Anthropological investigations allowed us to observe pathological conditions as poor dental health, pulmonary pathology and a left renal stone. The renal stone was endoscopically removed and submitted to binocular stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy also with microanalysis and X-ray diffraction analysis. The ovoid mass measured 22x16x15 mm, showing surface spherical buds and a nucleus of sharpedged crystals with concentric laminations. Chemical elements were C, O, N, Ca, P, K, S, Cl, Na, arranged in calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite) (90\%) and calcium phosphate (hydroxylapatite) (10\%). The stone composition indicates a high animal protein intake by the subject, confirming that he belonged to high social class. The co-existence of caries, without major arthritic changes indicates that this man lived a life free from extensive labour. In fact, his death appears to be related to infectious complications of renal urolithiasis.},

The main effects have been detected on: mobility, environment, social media and people flows. While in this first report only mobility, transport and environment are reported. The analysis performed identified a strong reduction of the mobility and transport activities, and in the pollutants. The mobility reduction has been assessed to be quite coherent with respect to what has been described by Google Global mobility report. On the other hand, in this paper a number of additional aspects have been put in evidence providing detailed aspects on mobility and parking that allowed us to better analyze the impact of the reopening on an eventual revamping of the infection. To this end, the collected data from the field have been compared from those of google and some considerations with respect to the Imperial college Report 20 have been derived. For the pollutant aspects, a relevant reduction on most of them has been measured and rationales are reported.},

We have qualitatively assessed the selected volcano–tectonic geosites by applying a set of criteria derived from previous studies and illustrated them through ﬁeld photographs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured images and 3-D models. Finally, we have discussed and compared the diﬀerent options and advantages provided by such visualization techniques and proposed a novel, cutting-edge approach to geoheritage promotion and popularization, based on interactive, navigable Virtual Outcrops made available online.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in ﬁtting a model to data, using as an example the ﬁt of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares ﬁtting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being ﬁt. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent ﬁtting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are “nuisance parameters” to marginalize away.},

We propose a new approach that is solely based on plane homographies, calculated from point correspondences, and that does not require the recovery of the 3D structure of the scene. Neither vanishing points nor lines need to be extracted from the images. The case of a moving camera with constant intrinsic parameters and the one of cameras with possibly different parameters are both addressed. Extensive experiments with both synthetic and real images have validated our approach.},

The Python framework is used for computation and visualization and integrates the common programs for earthquake data processing, such as GAD.exe, JHD.exe, and HypoDD.exe. It is also integrates the common procedure of routine data processing in earthquake seismology and works in local and regional scale. In this paper, we shows the preliminary results of LINDU software for several functions. To identify arrival time of P-wave we employ Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), MER (Modified Energy Ratio) and S/L Kurt’s method. The results of these method will be considered as guided – auto picking. However, the results also can be treated as reference for picking manually with Seisgram2k.jar. Geiger’s method is employed to locate the event location. The events can be relocated and 1D velocity can be updated by employing Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD). The next method to relocate the event location is Double Difference (DD) algorithm. The precision result of Lindu software has been tested using IRIS and real data available which run seamlessly.},

However, in quantitative seismology, achieving accurate, bias-free earthquake locations still remains to be the one of most important and challenging tasks. In this article, we give an overview on various earthquake location methods, that vary from linearized to nonlinear, from grid search to probabilistic algorithms. We review single and multipleevent location techniques, along with computational complexities of each algorithm. An example from a real-world earthquake location problem is given to highlight the importance of data availability in achieving bias-free earthquake locations. We discuss earthquake location accuracy, and uncertainty estimation that originate from measurement and modelling errors. We end with a list that summarizes publicly available earthquake location software packages. We conclude with an outlook for future directions towards data driven machine learning techniques in earthquake location research.},

	abstract = {Horses have a tendency to utilize a relatively narrow set of speeds near the middle of a much broader range they are capable of using within a particular gait, i.e., a preferred speed. Possible explanations for this behavior include minimizing musculoskeletal stresses and maximizing metabolic economy. If metabolic economy (cost of transport, C

To test this hypothesis, preferred speed was measured in trotting horses ( n = 7) unloaded on the level and loaded with 19\% of their body weight on the level.

The displacement required to produce melting depends on the magnitude of the regional stress and also on the friction stress. If both stresses are one kilobar melting can occur for displacements as small as one millimetre. If, however, both stresses are ten bars melting is impossible for any observed displacement. It is estimated that the width of the melted zone could be between 2 mm and lcm. Melting on fault planes during earthquakes is not in disagreementwith geological and geophysical observations, and suggests a new explanation for some mylonites. Melting may be important because the molten film rock formed on the fault may act as a lubricant and in the case of large earthquakes allow the release of almost all the elastic strain in the region of the shock. This would provide an important constraint in estimating the state of stress along a fault.},

The wealth of publicly-available seismic data nowadays requires automated, fast, and reliable tools to carry out a multitude of tasks, such as the detection of small, local earthquakes in areas characterized by sparsity of receivers. A similar application of machine learning, however, should be built on a large amount of labeled seismograms, which is neither immediate to obtain nor to compile. In this study we present a large dataset of seismograms recorded along the vertical, north, and east components of 1487 broad-band or very broad-band receivers distributed worldwide; this includes 629,095 3component seismograms generated by 304,878 local earthquakes and labeled as EQ, and 615,847 ones labeled as noise (AN). Application of machine learning to this dataset shows that a simple Convolutional Neural Network of 67,939 parameters allows discriminating between earthquakes and noise single-station recordings, even if applied in regions not represented in the training set. Achieving an accuracy of 96.7, 95.3, and 93.2\% on training, validation, and test set, respectively, we prove that the large variety of geological and tectonic settings covered by our data supports the generalization capabilities of the algorithm, and makes it applicable to real-time detection of local events. We make the database publicly available, intending to provide the seismological and broader scientiﬁc community with a benchmark for time-series to be used as a testing ground in signal processing.},

The microstructural record of fault rocks active at the brittle–ductile transition zone (BDTZ) may retain information on the rheological parameters driving the switch in deformation mode and on the role of stress and fluid pressure in controlling different fault slip behaviours. In this study we analysed the deformation microstructures of the strike-slip fault zone BFZ045 in Olkiluoto (SW Finland), located in the site of a deep geological repository for nuclear waste. We combined microstructural analysis, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and mineral chemistry data to reconstruct the variations in pressure, temperature, fluid pressure, and differential stress that mediated deformation and strain localization along BFZ045 across the BDTZ. BFZ045 exhibits a mixed ductile–brittle deformation, with a narrow ({\textless}20 cm thick) brittle fault core with cataclasites and pseudotachylytes that overprint a wider (60–100 cm thick) quartz-rich mylonite. Mylonitic deformation took place at 400–500 ∘C and 3–4 kbar, typical of the greenschist facies metamorphism at the base of the seismogenic crust. We used the recrystallized grain size piezometry for quartz to document a progressive increase in differential stress, from ca. 50 to ca. 120 MPa, towards the shear zone centre during mylonitization and strain localization. Syn-kinematic quartz veins formed along the mylonitic foliation due to transiently high pore fluid pressure (up to lithostatic value). The overprint of the veins by dynamic recrystallization and mylonitic creep is further evidence of the occurrence of brittle events under overall ductile conditions. We propose a conceptual model in which the ductile–brittle deformation cycle was controlled by transient oscillations in fluid pressure and progressively higher differential stress, possibly occurring in a narrowing shear zone deforming towards the peak strength of the crust at the BDTZ.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The dynamic evolution of fault zones at the seismogenic
brittle–ductile transition zone (BDTZ) expresses the delicate interplay
between numerous physical and chemical processes. Deformation and fluid flow
at the BDTZ are closely related and mutually dependent during repeating and
transient cycles of frictional and viscous deformation. Despite numerous
studies documenting in detail seismogenic faults exhumed from the BDTZ,
uncertainties remain as to the exact role of fluids in facilitating broadly
coeval brittle and ductile deformation at that structural level. We combine
structural analysis, fluid inclusion, and mineral chemistry data from
synkinematic and authigenic minerals to reconstruct the temporal variations
in fluid pressure (Pf), temperature (T), and bulk composition (X) of
the fluids that mediated deformation and steered strain localization along
BFZ300, a strike–slip fault originally active at the BDTZ. BFZ300 deforms
the Paleoproterozoic migmatitic basement of southwestern Finland and hosts
in its core two laterally continuous quartz veins formed by two texturally
distinct types of quartz – Qtz I and Qtz II, with Qtz I older than Qtz II.
Veins within the damage zone are formed exclusively by Qtz I. Mesostructural and
microstructural analysis combined with fluid compositional data indicate
recurrent cycles of mutually overprinting brittle and ductile deformation
triggered by oscillations of fluid pressure peaking at 210 MPa. Fluid
inclusion microthermometry and mineral pair geothermometry indicate that the
two documented quartz types precipitated from different fluid batches, with
bulk salinities in the 1 wt \% NaCleq–5 wt \% NaCleq range for Qtz I and in the 6 wt \% NaCleq–11 wt \% NaCleq range for Qtz II.
The temperature of the fluids involved with
initial strain localization and later fault reactivation evolved through
time from {\textgreater} 350 ∘C during Qtz I precipitation to
{\textless} 300 ∘C at the time of Qtz II crystallization. The peak
fluid pressure estimates constrain pore pressure oscillations between 80 and
210 MPa during the recorded faulting episodes. Our results suggest
variability of the physico-chemical conditions of the fluids steering
deformation (Pf, T, X), reflecting the ingress and effects of
multiple batches of fluid in the fault zone. Initial fluid-mediated
embrittlement generated a diffuse network of joints and/or hybrid–shear
fractures in the damage zone; subsequent strain localization led to more
localized deformation within the fault core. Localization was guided by
cyclically increasing fluid pressure and transient embrittlement of a system
that was otherwise under overall ductile conditions. Our analysis suggests that fluid overpressure at the BDTZ can play a key
role in the initial embrittlement of the deforming rock and steer subsequent
strain localization.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that plume arrival at the base of the lithosphere introduces a push force that overwhelms the balance of torques driving plate circuits, leading to plate-tectonic reorganizations. Among the most compelling evidence in support of a “plume-push” mechanism is the apparent coincidence between eruption of the Deccan flood basalts around 67–64 Ma and a short-lived increase in Indian (and decrease in African) plate speed. Using existing and newly calculated high-resolution plate-motion models, we show that plate divergence rates briefly increased throughout the Indo-Atlantic circuit, contrary to the expected effects of plume-push. We propose that this circuit-wide spike in divergence rates is best explained as the artifact of a magnetic reversal time-scale error around the much studied CretaceousTertiary boundary, and that the period spanning chrons C29–C28 lasted 70\% longer than currently assumed. Corrected for this error, the residual long-term patterns of Indo-Atlantic plate motions and accompanying plate-tectonic reorganization are explicable in terms of maturation of the circuit’s spreading ridges, without invoking a significant plume-push force.},

	abstract = {For many scientiﬁc calculations, particularly those involving empirical data, IEEE 32-bit ﬂoating-point arithmetic produces results of sufﬁcient accuracy, while for other applications IEEE 64-bit ﬂoating-point is more appropriate. But for some very demanding applications, even higher levels of precision are often required. This article discusses the challenge of high-precision computation, in the context of mathematical physics, and highlights what facilities are required to support future computation, in light of emerging developments in computer architecture.},

An investigation of those areas more susceptible to rockfall represents a key approach to improve the analysis and management of rockfall impact and consequences. The proposed procedure involves the study of occurred rockfall databases and thematic maps to compute a susceptibility map, by the employment of Analytical Hierarchic Process. The computation is focused on the road network of Aosta Valley Region (northwestern Italy) and its proximity. The model results highlight the importance of morphometric factors on the investigated phenomena. The outcomes of the analysis were also validated by comparing rockfall databases with the receiver operating characteristic curve, in order to conﬁrm their reliability. The results of the procedure are a starting point for a detailed planning action in order to manage the hazard related to these phenomena.},

Asquenched low-carbon steels with a martensitic or martensitic-bainitic microstructure are modern ultra-high-strength structural steels. They can possess sufficient toughness, formability, and weldability, and are typically used in weight-critical and high-performance structures. Common problems with as-quenched steels with a yield strength of 900 MPa or more are that they do not obey the conventional correlation between the fracture toughness reference temperature T0 and the impact toughness transition temperature T28J used in many standards and structural integrity assessment procedures, and a lack of design rules in general.},

            Many volcanic systems around the world are located beneath, or in close proximity to, ice caps. Mass change of these ice caps causes surface movements, which are typically neglected when interpreting surface deformation measurements around these volcanoes. These movements can however be significant and may closely resemble movements due to magma accumulation. Here we show such an example, from Katla volcano, Iceland. Horizontal movements observed by GPS on the flank of Katla have led to the inference of significant inflow of magma into a chamber beneath the caldera, starting in 2000 and continuing over several years. We use satellite radar interferometry and GPS data to show that between 2001 and 2010, the horizontal movements seen on the flank can be explained by the response to the long term shrinking of ice caps and that erratic movements seen at stations within the caldera are also not likely to signify magma inflow. It is important that interpretations of geodetic measurements at volcanoes in glaciated areas consider the effect of ice mass change and previous studies should be carefully reevaluated.},

              The magmatic history of the Oldest Toba Tuff (OTT), the second largest in volume after the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT), northern Sumatra, Indonesia, was investigated using U–Pb zircon dating by LA-ICP-MS. Zircon dates obtained from surface and interior sections yielded ages of 0.84 ± 0.03 Ma and 0.97 ± 0.03 Ma, respectively. The youngest OTT zircon ages were in accordance with the

              Ar eruption age of {\textasciitilde} 0.8 Ma, whereas the oldest zircon dates were {\textasciitilde} 1.20 Ma. Therefore, the distribution of zircon U–Pb ages is interpreted to reflect protracted zircon crystallization, suggesting that the estimated 800–2,300 km
              3
              of OTT magma accumulated and evolved for at least 400,000 years prior to eruption. This result is comparable to the volume and timescales of YTT magmatism. The similarities of both magmatic duration and geochemistry between OTT and YTT may indicate that they are similar in size and that the caldera collapse that generated OTT might be much larger previously interpreted.},

	abstract = {Objectives Persons with spinal cord injury live with neurogenic bowel dysfunction. Difﬁculties with management of neurogenic bowel can increase over time with age and time post injury, with a negative impact on autonomy and quality of life. Many conservative treatments are available to improve bowel management; however, in case of failure, a colostomy may be considered. Setting Specialized Care Unit, Montecatone Rehabilitation Institute and General Surgery Division, Imola Hospital, Imola, Italy.
Methods From 2016 to 2019, selected patients affected by SCI and bowel dysfunction failing conservative care were treated with subtotal colectomy associated with placement of a bioabsorbable prosthesis, to prevent parastomal hernia. The surgical procedure is presented along with results.
Results Overall, 19 individuals underwent the described procedure; after 1 year of follow-up, we observed four minor complications: two cases of dehiscence of the abdominal incision, easily treated during hospital stay, and two cases of leakage of mucorrhoea.
Conclusion Our results demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the procedure to improve bowel management in persons with spinal cord injury. Introduction Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) often present neurogenic bowel dysfunction [1, 2]. The most reported difﬁculties are represented by constipation, abdominal pain, incontinence, taking a long time for bowel care, and susceptibility to autonomic dysreﬂexia. Difﬁculties increase over time with age and duration of the SCI. Bowel problems largely affect quality of life and represent “a major physical and psychological problem in SCI” [3–5]. Individuals with neurogenic bowel disease suffer not only because of the symptoms related to SCI, but also because of the social isolation caused by the fear of intestinal accidents. This},

Therefore, severe droughts of extended duration could have led to large variations in the frequency and intensity of geyser eruptions. To characterize potential changes in eruption activity of the iconic Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park over past centuries, we collected mineralized wood samples from its mound and used radiocarbon to date when these trees grew. Because trees do not live on active geyser mounds, we infer that the trees grew during a protracted period without eruptions. The dated fossil trees are from the 13th and 14th Centuries during a time with severe multidecadal droughts in the region. Because climate models forecast increasingly severe droughts by mid21st century, geyser eruptions could become less frequent or completely cease.},

	abstract = {Stress orientations are determined for the Friuli area from focal mechanisms using the inversion technique of Gephart and Forsyth (1984). The data consist of 244 fault plane solutions selected for the period 1988—1995. Where the data coverage was poor, this period was extended to 1978—1996. Local magnitude ranges from 2.0 to 4.3 and the depths extend from 4 to 16 km. The Friuli area is subdivided into ﬁve seismotectonic zones on the basis of tectonic characteristics, seismic activity and focal mechanisms, and for each zone a stress tensor is determined. The results show that the active tectonic stress in the Friuli area is heterogeneous and conditioned by the complex structural pattern, which is characterized by two indented tectonic wedges. The western and central parts of the area are mainly affected by a compressional state of stress, while in the eastern part a strike-slip state of stress prevails. The orientation of the principal stresses varies from the western to the eastern part of the area, and differences are also noticeable with depth. In the central part of the Friuli area the maximum compressional stress is N—S trending at shallow depths ({\textless}10 km), changing to NW—SE at deeper levels. The maximum compressional stress is NW—SE oriented in the western part, while in the eastern part it is N—S oriented.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Universal access to pulse oximetry worldwide is often limited by cost and has substantial public health consequences. Low-cost pulse oximeters have become increasingly available with limited regulatory agency oversight. The accuracy of these devices often has not been validated, raising questions about performance.
METHODS: The accuracy of 6 low-cost finger pulse oximeters during stable arterial oxygen saturations (Sao2) between 70\% and 100\% was evaluated in 22 healthy subjects. Oximeters tested were the Contec CMS50DL, Beijing Choice C20, Beijing Choice MD300C23, Starhealth SH-A3, Jumper FPD-500A, and Atlantean SB100 II. Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve 10 to 12 stable target Sao2 plateaus between 70\% and 100\% and Paco2 values of 35 to 45 mm Hg. Comparisons of pulse oximeter readings (Spo2) with arterial Sao2 (by Radiometer ABL90 and OSM3) were used to calculate bias (Spo2 – Sao2) mean, precision (SD of the bias), and root mean square error (ARMS).
RESULTS: Pulse oximeter readings corresponding to 536 blood samples were analyzed. Four of the 6 oximeters tested showed large errors (up to −6.30\% mean bias, precision 4.30\%, 7.53 ARMS) in estimating saturation when Sao2 was reduced {\textless}80\%, and half of the oximeters demonstrated large errors when estimating saturations between 80\% and 90\%. Two of the pulse oximeters tested (Contec CMS50DL and Beijing Choice C20) demonstrated ARMS of {\textless}3\% at Sao2 between 70\% and 100\%, thereby meeting International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria for accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Many low-cost pulse oximeters sold to consumers demonstrate highly inaccurate readings. Unexpectedly, the accuracy of some low-cost pulse oximeters tested here performed similarly to more expensive, ISO-cleared units when measuring hypoxia in healthy subjects. None of those tested here met World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists standards, and the ideal testing conditions do not necessarily translate these findings to the clinical setting. Nonetheless, further development of accurate, low-cost oximeters for use in clinical practice is feasible and, if pursued, could improve access to safe care, especially in lowincome countries.  (Anesth Analg 2016;123:338–45)},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Detailed knowledge of Holocene climate and glaciers dynamics is essential for sustainable development in warming mountain regions. Yet information about Holocene glacier coverage in the Alps before the Little Ice Age stems mostly from studying advances of glacier tongues at lower elevations. Here we present a new approach to reconstructing past glacier low stands and ice-free conditions by assessing and dating the oldest ice preserved at high elevations. A previously unexplored ice dome at Weißseespitze summit (3500 m), near where the “Tyrolean Iceman” was found, offers almost ideal conditions for preserving the original ice formed at the site. The glaciological settings and state-of-the-art micro-radiocarbon age constraints indicate that the summit has been glaciated for about 5900 years. In combination with known maximum ages of other high Alpine glaciers, we present evidence for an elevation gradient of neoglaciation onset. It reveals that in the Alps only the highest elevation sites remained ice-covered throughout the Holocene. Just before the life of the Iceman, high Alpine summits were emerging from nearly ice-free conditions, during the start of a Mid-Holocene neoglaciation. We demonstrate that, under specific circumstances, the old ice at the base of high Alpine glaciers is a sensitive archive of glacier change. However, under current melt rates the archive at Weißseespitze and at similar locations will be lost within the next two decades.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Nördlinger Ries and the Steinheim Basin are widely perceived as a Middle Miocene impact crater doublet. We discovered two independent earthquake-produced seismite horizons in North Alpine Foreland Basin deposits potentially related to both impacts. The older seismite horizon, demonstrated to be associated with the Ries impact, is overlain by distal impact ejecta in situ, forming a unique continental seismite-ejecta couplet within a distance of up to 180 km from the crater. The younger seismite unit, also produced by a major palaeo-earthquake, comprises clastic dikes that cut through the Ries seismite-ejecta couplet. The clastic dikes may have formed in response to the Steinheim impact, some kyr after the Ries impact, in line with paleontologic results that indicate a time gap of about 0.5 Myr between the Ries and Steinheim events. This interpretation suggests the Ries and Steinheim impacts represent two temporally separate events in Southern Germany that, thus, witnessed a double disaster in the Middle Miocene. The magnitude–distance relationship of seismite formation during large earthquakes suggests the seismic and destructive potential of impact-induced earthquakes may be underestimated.},

            The South China Sea (SCS) is a highly semi-enclosed marginal sea located in the East Asian monsoon region. This paper proposes interesting aspects of the unique feature of the SCS waves in response to tropical cyclone's passage when large-scale winter monsoon winds prevail. We use the wave model WaveWatch III to study the wave characteristics of typhoon Durian (2006) passing over the middle of SCS in early December 2006, and state the new understanding acquired in the aspects of the tropical cyclone generated waves in the SCS during winter monsoon surge. In light of this, the role of the large-scale NE monsoon winds on winter typhoon wave field characteristics in the SCS are highlighted by conducting sensitivity experiments with and without the NE monsoon winds. The NE monsoon winds weakly affect the SWH field near the typhoon track and strongly away from the track, especially in the deep water area of the northern SCS where the NE monsoon winds produce high waves. Comparisons between the two experiments show the effect of the NE monsoon winds on the directional wave spectra in the SCS, suggesting that the monsoon-generated swells do not decay and remain throughout the typhoon period.},

With all of these parameters measured, we calculated that fully grown penguins generate pressures of around 10 kPa (77 mm Hg) to expel watery material and 60 kPa (450 mm Hg) to expel material of higher viscosity similar to that of olive oil. The forces involved, lying well above those known for humans, are high, but do not lead to an energetically wasteful turbulent ﬂow. Whether a bird chooses the direction into which it decides to expel its faeces, and what role the wind plays in this, remain unknown.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that mixed and penalty finite element methods can routinely solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This paper shows by means of simple examples that problems can arise even for the simpler Stokes equations. The causes of the problem fall in either of two categories: round-off and ill conditioning, or a poor choice of pressure discretization. Nonsensical solutions can be obtained. Computation of the discrete divergence of the flow field is a simpleand powerful tool to diagnose such conditions. In the first part of the paper several simple techniques for minimizing the effect of round-off are reviewed. In the second part it is shown that, for coupled flow problems, care must be exercised in the choice of the pressure approximation. A unified treatment of various observations by different workers is presented. This should prove useful for general users of the finite element method.},

	abstract = {Geological and geochemical research in the internal zone of the Himalayan orogen reveal evidence for complex relationships between regional metamorphism, anatexis, thrust faulting and normal faulting in Miocene time. Such interactions share many characteristics with those that define the behaviour of non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems, like chemical oscillators. The internal ordering of such systems arises spontaneously and is maintained by continual exchange of energy with the outside world. Mountain ranges are open thermodynamic systems, equally capable of displaying selforganized behaviour. They accumulate energy through a variety of mechanisms, particularly crustal thickening, but their non-equilibrium structure is maintained through compensating mechanisms of energy dissipation. The simultaneous operation of normal faults and thrust faults in the Himalayan system, ejecting a wedge of middle crust southward from the orogen towards the Indian foreland, was a remarkably efficient method of mass (and therefore energy) dissipation in Miocene time. Research in many branches of science suggests that thermodynamic systems forced far from equilibrium by their boundary conditions may evolve towards establishing the most efficient possible mechanisms for counteracting those conditions. For the Himalaya, one possible explanation for development of a process set characterized by simultaneous normal faulting and thrust faulting, linked through metamorphism and anatexis, is that simple physical erosion alone was inadequate to lrmderate the extraordinary crustal thickness and topographic gradients that characterized the southern flank of the range in Miocene time. The orogenic system may have adapted to this condition through a new and more efficient mechanism of energy dissipation that required the coordination of a variety of thermal and deformational processes.},

	abstract = {Phase diagrams of hydrous mid-ocean ridge (MOR) basalts to 330 km depth and of hydrous peridotites to 250 km depth are compiled for conditions characteristic for subduction zones. A synthesis of our experimentally determined phase relations of chlorite, lawsonite, epidote-zoisite, amphibole, paragonite, chloritoid, talc, and phengite in basalts and of phase relations from the literature of serpentine, talc, chlorite, amphibole, and phase A in ultramaﬁcs permits calculation of H2O contents in hydrous phase assemblages that occur in natural compositions. This yields the information necessary to calculate water budgets for descending slabs. Starting from low-grade blueschist conditions (10–20 km depth) with H2O contents between 5 and 6 wt\% for hydrated oceanic crust, complete dehydration is achieved between 70 and {\textgreater}300 km depth as a function of individual slab geotherms. Hydrous phases which decompose at depth below volcanic arcs are lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, and talc (š phengite) in maﬁc compositions and chlorite and serpentine in peridotite. Approximately 15–35\% of the initially subducted H2O are released below volcanic arcs. The contribution of amphibole dehydration to the water budget is small (5–20\%) and occurs at relatively shallow depth (65–90 km). In any predicted thermal structure, dehydration is a combination of a stepwise and a continuous process through many different reactions which occur simultaneously in the different portions of the descending slab. Such a dehydration characteristic is incompatible with ‘single phase dehydration models’ which focus ﬂuid ﬂow through a unique major dehydration event in order to explain volcanic fronts. As a consequence of continuously progressing dehydration, water ascending from the slab will be generally available to depth of ca. 150–200 km. The ﬂuid rising from the subducting lithosphere will cause partial melting in the hot portion of the mantle wedge. We propose that the volcanic front simply forms above the mantle wedge isotherm where the extent of melting is sufﬁcient to allow for the mechanical extraction of parental arc magmas. Thermal models show that such an isotherm (ca. 1300ºC) locates below volcanic fronts, slab surface depths below such an isotherm are compatible with the observed depths of the slab surface below volcanic fronts. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, because of several issues that can affect the data, the HVSR cannot be considered as valid per se, and a careful data evaluation is necessary. In this study, a series of HVSR curves are evaluated in order to highlight industrial components that can signiﬁcantly alter the natural HVSR. First, a controlled-source experiment is carried out in order to deﬁne the characteristics of spurious industrial signals. Data analysis shows that the coherence functions and the mildly smoothed amplitude spectra plotted with linear scales can help signiﬁcantly in identifying industrial components that can be otherwise difﬁcult to highlight. Coherence functions appear particularly interesting because of their ability to reveal the presence of industrial components independently of their amplitude. Field data from three sites are then analyzed on the basis of the evidence obtained through the controlled-source experiment. For the third site, data recorded on two different days are considered. While in the ﬁrst data set no signiﬁcant industrial component is present, in the second and third data sets, a series of remarkable industrial signals that severely alter the natural HVSR are identiﬁed. The assessment of the coherence functions and mildly smoothed amplitude spectra is therefore suggested as a valuable support to avoid pitfalls in the interpretation of the experimental HVSR. Finally, two quick and dirty procedures aimed at reducing the effect of industrial components are also presented.},

            The accurate representation of data is essential in science communication. However, colour maps that visually distort data through uneven colour gradients or are unreadable to those with colour-vision deficiency remain prevalent in science.

We show how scientifically derived colour maps report true data variations, reduce complexity, and are accessible for people with colour-vision deficiencies. We highlight ways for the scientific community to identify and prevent the misuse of colour in science, and call for a proactive step away from colour misuse among the community, publishers, and the press.},

The speciﬁc energy, the weir coefﬁcient and the velocity distribution coefﬁcient are considered as local variables, then for the explicit integration, the respective average values along the short side weir elements are assumed. The water surface proﬁles and the discharges for ﬂow over side weirs, obtained with the proposed relation and valid for rectangular channels, are compared with experimental data for subcritical and supercritical ﬂow conditions. The validation of the method is accomplished by the comparison with the solution obtained by De Marchi’s classical hypothesis, about the speciﬁc energy, which is constant along a side weir.

This pedagogic study aimed to highlight potential biases in research on COVID-19 treatment. Methods: We evaluate the eﬀect of coﬀee’s active part, 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine (TMX) on patients with COVID-19. A cohort of 93 patients, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 is analyzed. Results: TMX group and control group included, respectively, 26 and 67 patients. In the TMX group, patients had a median length of stay in hospital of 5.5 days shorter than in the control group (9.5 vs. 15 days, p {\textless} 0.05). Patients in the control group were more severe than patients in the TMX group with a signiﬁcantly higher National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS-2 score) (8 vs. 6, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Multiple biases prevents us from concluding to an eﬀect of coﬀee on COVID-19. Despite an important social pressure during this crisis, methodology and conscientiousness are the best way to avoid hasty conclusions that can be deleterious for patients. Identiﬁer: NCT04395742.},

We discuss common features of these ideas, how they relate to modern computing and big data, and how they might be developed and extended in future decades. The goal of this article is to provoke thought and discussion regarding the larger themes of research in statistics and data science.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

We present new observations of a candidate exomoon associated with Kepler-1625b using the Hubble Space Telescope to validate or refute the moon’s presence. We find evidence in favor of the moon hypothesis, based on timing deviations and a flux decrement from the star consistent with a large transiting exomoon. Self-consistent photodynamical modeling suggests that the planet is likely several Jupiter masses, while the exomoon has a mass and radius similar to Neptune. Since our inference is dominated by a single but highly precise Hubble epoch, we advocate for future monitoring of the system to check model predictions and confirm repetition of the moon-like signal.},

The order of magnitude of the maximum ice thickness is predicted using Weisskopf’s heuristic argument for the maximum height of a mountain, which involves only the specific latent heat of fusion and the acceleration of gravity. The local thickness of a glacier depends on the assumed ice rheology. The equations describing the steady state longitudinal glacier profile differ greatly for perfectly plastic ice and for ice following Glen’s law. Analytical solutions of these equations are derived: they fit well the data for ice caps but less so for alpine glaciers. Volume-area scaling, a major tool of glaciology, is discussed in relation with glacier profiles.},

	abstract = {Of all hypotheses advanced for why zebras have stripes, avoidance of biting fly attack receives by far the most support, yet the mechanisms by which stripes thwart landings are not yet understood. A logical and popular hypothesis is that stripes interfere with optic flow patterns needed by flying insects to execute controlled landings. This could occur through disrupting the radial symmetry of optic flow via the aperture effect (i.e. generation of false motion cues by straight edges), or through spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e. misregistration of repeated features) of evenly spaced stripes. By recording and reconstructing tabanid fly behaviour around horses wearing differently patterned rugs, we could tease out these hypotheses using realistic target stimuli. We found that flies avoided landing on, flew faster near, and did not approach as close to striped and checked rugs compared to grey. Our observations that flies avoided checked patterns in a similar way to stripes refutes the hypothesis that stripes disrupt optic flow via the aperture effect, which critically demands parallel striped patterns. Our data narrow the menu of fly-equid visual interactions that form the basis for the extraordinary colouration of zebras.},

To solve a problem they may simply look for an equation with the correct variables and assume it meets their needs, rather than selecting an equation that represents the appropriate physical process. These issues can be addressed by encouraging students to think of equations as stories, and to describe them in prose. This is the goal of the Equation Dictionary project, used in Western Washington University’s introductory geophysics course. Throughout the course, students create personal dictionaries consisting of (a) the equation itself, (b) a brief description of variables, (c) a prose description of the physical process described by the equation, and (d) additional notes that help them understand the equation. In writing these definitions students learn that equations are simplified descriptions of physical processes, and that understanding the process is more useful than memorizing a sequence of variables. Dictionaries also serve as formula sheets for exams, a task that encourages students to write meaningful, organized definitions. Furthermore, instructor review of the dictionaries is an excellent way to identify student misconceptions and learn how well they understand derivations and lectures.},

We describe a rare case series of fatal honey poisoning caused by Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) in Southwest China. Three male construction workers were delivered to the emergency department with symptoms of food poisoning after ingestion of wild raw honey. Laboratory results showed that the 3 patients were at different degrees of renal damage, and 1 patient with severe symptoms died of acute renal failure 1 day after admission. Pollen analysis indicated that the suspected honey was heavily contaminated with TwHF pollen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for such poisoning. Pollen analysis is a practical approach to help diagnosis in remote areas where such honey poisoning occurs.},

In the area, the Visignano chaotic body (VIS) constitutes an intercalation within the Serravallian-Tortonian MA and derives, as the SVU, from the frontal part of the Ligurian wedge.

	abstract = {Mont Blanc, the summit of Western Europe, is a popular but demanding high-altitude ascent. Drug use is thought to be widespread among climbers attempting this summit, not only to prevent altitude illnesses, but also to boost physical and/or psychological capacities. This practice may be unsafe in this remote alpine environment. However, robust data on medication during the ascent of Mont Blanc are lacking. Individual urine samples from male climbers using urinals in mountain refuges on access routes to Mont Blanc (Goûter and Cosmiques mountain huts) were blindly and anonymously collected using a hidden automatic sampler. Urine samples were screened for a wide range of drugs, including diuretics, glucocorticoids, stimulants, hypnotics and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Out of 430 samples analyzed from both huts, 35.8\% contained at least one drug. Diuretics (22.7\%) and hypnotics (12.9\%) were the most frequently detected drugs, while glucocorticoids (3.5\%) and stimulants (3.1\%) were less commonly detected. None of the samples contained PDE-5 inhibitors. Two substances were predominant: the diuretic acetazolamide (20.6\%) and the hypnotic zolpidem (8.4\%). Thirty three samples were found positive for at least two substances, the most frequent combination being acetazolamide and a hypnotic (2.1\%). Based on a novel sampling technique, we demonstrate that about one third of the urine samples collected from a random sample of male climbers contained one or several drugs, suggesting frequent drug use amongst climbers ascending Mont Blanc. Our data suggest that medication primarily aims at mitigating the symptoms of altitude illnesses, rather than enhancing performance. In this hazardous environment, the relatively high prevalence of hypnotics must be highlighted, since these molecules may alter vigilance.},

The first was direct goring by the bison's horn, "hooking," resulting in deep puncture wounds most often to buttocks or thighs. Abdominal injury, including evisceration, was also seen. Blunt trauma occurred as the victim was shoved or butted by the animal's head, or when the victim sustained a rapid deceleration on ground impact after being tossed into the air. Multiple sites and types of fractures, abrasions, and contusions were seen. Most patients requiring hospital care for goring wounds were treated with operative debridement and primary closure. Cultures of puncture wounds were uniformly negative. Injuries from bison exceed injuries from bears or any other wild animals in Yellowstone National Park.},

This is a summary of case series reported or observed elsewhere. Bear-inflicted human injury and death is rare. Brown bear attacks tend to be severe and to occur suddenly, without provocation. Black bear attacks usually result in minor injuries and tend to be predacious. Polar bear attacks are ex.ceedingly rare, and the ferocity of polar bears has probably been overemphasized. Bear-inflicted wounds should be treated as major trauma in accordance with advanced trauma life support guidelines.

	abstract = {IntroductiondAlthough bear attacks on humans are uncommon, the incidence has slowly risen as human populations increasingly encroach on wilderness habitat. In the Kingdom of Bhutan, Himalayan black bear attacks occur regularly. Bears preferentially attack the face, often causing injuries that require surgical airway management. We sought to determine how often patients injured by Himalayan black bears required airway management during initial resuscitation.
MethodsdWe conducted a retrospective review of emergency department and admission records of the 3 referral hospitals in Bhutan. We identiﬁed all victims of bear attacks in Bhutan who received emergency airway management, including surgical airway management during the period from August 2013 to December 2017.
ResultsdThere were 21 patients who were treated for injuries from bear attacks during the study period. Of these, 12 required emergency airway management. Three patients who required emergency airways (2 intubations, 1 surgical airway) were attacked near a regional referral hospital and received care at that hospital. The remaining 9 patients received care from the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) retrieval team (1 intubation, 8 surgical airways).
ConclusionsdThe use of highly trained HEMS critical care retrieval teams may improve outcomes in critically injured patients who require time-critical airway management in remote areas. Countries such as Bhutan with populations far from emergency and critical care might beneﬁt from the establishment of HEMS critical care retrieval services. HEMS teams providing care while retrieving patients from austere environments should be expert in emergency airway management.},

	abstract = {Ankle fracture/dislocations are generally low-energy injuries most commonly seen in older adults. Prompt reduction is indicated when evacuation to deﬁnitive care would be prolonged or neurovascular compromise to the foot is suspected. Reduction restores neurovascular integrity, realigns joint contact surfaces, reduces pain, and decreases soft-tissue edema. The hematoma block is a safe, easy, and effective method of obtaining adequate anesthesia to allow manipulation of displaced fractures. Although most commonly used for distal radius fractures, the hematoma block has been demonstrated to be as effective as conscious sedation for ankle reduction analgesia. Use of hematoma block is ideal for the wilderness setting because it requires few supplies, is easy to perform, and is effective. Quigley’s traction consists of suspending the injured leg in a tubular fabric sling to allow gradual relaxation of deforming muscle forces and eventual reduction of a displaced ankle. For those displaced ankle fractures that are not amenable to reduction by direct manipulation, Quigley’s traction applied after hematoma block may allow successful reduction. Improvised Quigley’s traction can be built in a wilderness setting using available clothing. After successful reduction, fractured ankles should be adequately stabilized and the affected extremity should be kept nonweight bearing. The hematoma block and improvised Quigley’s traction are valuable skills for the wilderness medical provider and may facilitate a successful and relatively pain-free reduction of dislocated ankle fractures in a wilderness setting.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, a proliferation of interest has emerged in the area of avalanche survival, yielding both an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of death after avalanche burial and technological advances in the development of survival equipment. The dismal survival statistics born out of the modern era of winter recreation unmistakably reveal that elapsed time and depth of burial are the most critical variables of survival and the focus of newer survival devices on the market. Although blunt trauma may kill up to one third of avalanche victims, early asphyxiation is the predominant mechanism of death, and hypothermia is rare. A survival plateau or delay in asphyxiation may be seen in those buried in respiratory communication with an air pocket until a critical accumulation of CO2 or an ice lens develops. The newest survival devices available for adjunctive protection, along with a transceiver and shovel, are the artiﬁcial air pocket device (AvaLung), the avalanche air bag system (ABS), and the Avalanche Ball. The artiﬁcial air pocket prolongs adequate respiration during snow burial and may improve survival by delaying asphyxiation. The ABS, which forces the wearer to the surface of the avalanche debris by inverse segregation to help prevent burial, has been in use in Europe for the last 10 years with an impressive track record. Finally, the Avalanche Ball is a visual locator device in the form of a spring-loaded ball attached to a tether, which is released from a fanny pack by a rip cord. Despite the excitement surrounding these novel technologies, avalanche avoidance through knowledge and conservative judgment will always be the mainstay of avalanche survival, never to be replaced by any device.},

	abstract = {Background.—Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in North America. With nearly 2,500 Appalachian Trail (AT) hikers entering the endemic area for as long as 6 months, exposure to the disease is likely. The characteristic exanthem of erythema migrans (EM) should be a trigger for seeking medical treatment, and its recognition in this relatively isolated environment is important.
Objective.—The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of AT hikers to identify EM, the exanthem of Lyme disease.
Methods.—Hikers were administered a photographic stimulus in this Internal Review Board–approved pilot study. Historical hiking data, basic demographics, and self-reported treatment and diagnosis were collected.
Results.—In all, 379 responses were collected by 4 researchers at 3 geographically separate locations at or proximate to the AT from June 2011 to May 2012. Fifty-four percent of respondents (206 of 379) were able to recognize the photographs of EM/Lyme disease; 46\% could not. Of those who did recognize EM, 23 (6\%) had seen it either on themselves or on another hiker while on the AT. A total of 37 hikers stated that they had been diagnosed with Lyme disease while hiking, and of these, 89\% were treated with antibiotics. Thirteen of these 37 hikers (35\%) diagnosed with Lyme disease had visualized an embedded tick. Nine percent of all respondents reported they had been diagnosed with Lyme disease by a healthcare practitioner, whether from EM, symptomatology, or by titer.
Conclusions.—This study suggests that hikers are poorly able to recognize the characteristic exanthem of Lyme disease but have a high exposure risk.},

It is unknown whether permethrin treatment of a location, such as a campsite, provides passive prophylaxis reducing mosquito bites among all persons in the immediate vicinity.
Methods.—This randomized, double-blind controlled trial used 0.4\% permethrin (2.5\% permethrin diluted by 7 parts water) sprayed once onto the external surface of canvas tents at a Boy Scout summer camp. During a 9-week period, subjects (n ϭ 545) completed nightly mosquito-bite and -landing counts for 5 minutes at dusk and recorded insect-repellent use within 2 hours of counting. Weekly mosquito sampling with CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traps occurred at study campsites. The primary outcome measure was the number of mosquito bites per 5 minutes.
Results.—A total of 1614 person nights averaged 5.1 Ϯ 7.2 (ϮSD) mosquito bites per 5 minutes. The permethrin-treated campsites had decreased mosquito landings and bites (relative risk reduction [RRR] 44\%; 95\% CI 34\% to 55\%; P Ͻ .001) compared with controls. Insect repellent was used only 32\% of nights, decreasing bites by 36\% (RRR 36\%; 95\% CI 25\% to 47\%; P Ͻ .001). Permethrin was superior to insect repellent alone (RRR 20\%; 95\% CI 4\% to 37\%; P ϭ .01).
Conclusions.—Permethrin treatment of tents is an effective, inexpensive public health measure to reduce mosquito bites. Permethrin is effective among all individuals in a camping setting and was more effective than topical insect repellent alone, which, although recommended, was inconsistently used.},

	abstract = {Objective.—A paucity of data exists regarding the use of iodophores such as povidone-iodine (PVI) to disinfect water. We sought to determine a practical minimal disinfecting concentration of 10\% PVI over different contact times and temperatures when added to water inoculated with E. coli.
Methods.—1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 dilutions of 10\% PVI were created. Escherichia coli was exposed to these dilutions for 5, 15, and 30 minutes at 10, 20, and 30oC. Bactericidal activity was neutralized with 0.5\% sodium thiosulfate. Mean viable colony forming units (CFUs) was determined after triplicate plating on Luria-bertani agar and 24 hours of incubation at 37oC. Effective bactericidal activity was deﬁned as a 5-log reduction.
Results.—Of the 200,000 E. coli plated, no CFUs were observed after exposure to the 1:100 dilution. After 5 minutes of contact time with the 1:1,000 dilution, at 10oC CFUs were too numerous to count (TNTC), at 20oC the mean CFU count was 92 (standard error Ϯ11), and at 30oC the mean CFU count was 25 (standard error Ϯ8). No CFUs were observed after 15 minutes of exposure to the 1:1,000 dilution across experimental temperatures. The 1:10,000 dilution always yielded CFU growth that was TNTC.
Conclusions.—The lowest disinfecting concentration of 10\% PVI was the 1:1,000 dilution at 15 minutes of contact time. This supports the use of PVI for water disinfection against E. coli, the organism most commonly responsible for traveler’s diarrhea. Further studies may assess its effectiveness against more virulent water borne pathogens.},

	abstract = {Objective.—Topical repellents can provide effective personal protection from tick-borne diseases by preventing the attachment of ticks. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a commercially available repellent spray containing both N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, previously known as N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and ethyl-butylacetylaminopropionate (EBAAP) against tick bites in a population at risk in Switzerland under real-life conditions.
Methods.—The effectiveness of an insect repellent spray containing both DEET and EBAAP was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ﬁeld study. The study, requiring simple application of the repellent to exposed skin, was carried out on 276 forestry workers and orienteers under everyday conditions in Switzerland from May to September 1999. We measured total effectiveness of the repellent by the following formula: percentage effectiveness ϭ 100 ϫ (TP Ϫ TR)/TP, where TP and TR were the average number of ticks per hour spent in wooded areas for the repellent and placebo groups, respectively.
Results.—The average number of tick bites per hour of exposure to wooded areas differed significantly between the placebo (n ϭ 138) and repellent (n ϭ 138) groups, 0.17 vs 0.10 (P Ͻ .05). Total repellent effectiveness against tick attachment was 41.1\% (95\% CI, 2.5–79.6). On the arms, an effectiveness of 66\% (95\% CI, 17.3–114.7) was observed. No signiﬁcant difference in the average number of unattached ticks could be found.
Conclusions.—This study found that an easily applied repellent is moderately effective in reducing the risk of tick bites.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions are fundamentally uncertain because no proxy is a direct record of a single environmental variable of interest; all proxies are indirect and sensitive to multiple forcing factors. One productive approach to reducing proxy uncertainty is the integration of information from multiple proxy systems with complementary, overlapping sensitivity. Mostly, such analyses are conducted in an ad hoc fashion, either through qualitative comparison to assess the similarity of single-proxy reconstructions or through step-wise quantitative interpretations where one proxy is used to constrain a variable relevant to the interpretation of a second proxy. Here we propose the integration of multiple proxies via the joint inversion of proxy system and paleoenvironmental time series models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The “Joint Proxy Inversion” (JPI) method provides a statistically robust approach to producing self-consistent interpretations of multi-proxy datasets, allowing full and simultaneous assessment of all proxy and model uncertainties to obtain quantitative estimates of past environmental conditions. Other benefits of the method include the ability to use independent information on climate and environmental systems to inform the interpretation of proxy data, to fully leverage information from unevenly and differently sampled proxy records, and to obtain refined estimates of proxy model parameters that are conditioned on paleo-archive data. Application of JPI to the marine Mg∕Ca and δ18O proxy systems at two distinct timescales demonstrates many of the key properties, benefits, and sensitivities of the method, and it produces new,
statistically grounded reconstructions of Neogene ocean temperature and chemistry from previously published data. We suggest that JPI is a
universally applicable method that can be implemented using proxy models of
wide-ranging complexity to generate more robust, quantitative understanding
of past climatic and environmental change.},

	abstract = {Many students, especially in econometrics, express frustration with the way a problem known as “bad control” is evaded, if not mishandled, in the traditional literature. The problem arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coeﬃcient and the eﬀect that the coeﬃcient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

	abstract = {Camera traps have become an important research tool for both conservation biologists and wildlife managers. Recent advances in spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have increasingly put camera traps at the forefront of population monitoring programs. These methods allow for benchmark analysis of species density without the need for invasive ﬁeldwork techniques. We conducted a review of SECR studies using camera traps to summarize the current focus of these investigations, as well as provide recommendations for future studies and identify areas in need of future investigation. Our analysis shows a strong bias in species preference, with a large proportion of studies focusing on large felids, many of which provide the only baseline estimates of population density for these species. Furthermore, we found that a majority of studies produced density estimates that may not be precise enough for long-term population monitoring. We recommend simulation and power analysis be conducted before initiating any particular study design and provide examples using readily available software. Furthermore, we show that precision can be increased by including a larger study area that will subsequently increase the number of individuals photo-captured. As many current studies lack the resources or manpower to accomplish such an increase in effort, we recommend that researchers incorporate new technologies such as machine-learning, web-based data entry, and online deployment management into their study design. We also cautiously recommend the potential of citizen science to help address these study design concerns. In addition, modiﬁcations in SECR model development to include species that have only a subset of individuals available for individual identiﬁcation (often called mark-resight models), can extend the process of explicit density estimation through camera trapping to species not individually identiﬁable.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, statistics educators have made important changes to introductory courses. Current guidelines emphasize developing statistical thinking in students and exposing them to the entire investigative process in the context of interesting research questions and real data. As a result, many concepts (confounding, multivariable models, study design, etc.) previously reserved only for higherlevel courses now appear in introductory courses. Despite these changes, causality is rarely discussed in introductory courses, except for warning students “correlation does not imply causation” or covering the special case of randomized controlled experiments. In this article, we argue causal inference concepts align well with statistics education guidelines for introductory courses by developing statistical and multivariable thinking, exposing students to many aspects of the investigative process, and fostering active learning. We discuss how to integrate causal inference concepts into introductory courses using causal diagrams and provide an illustrative example with youth smoking data. Through our website, we also provide a guided student activity and instructor resources. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

These models utilize the ordinal nature of the data by describing various modes of stochastic ordering and this eliminates the need for assigning scores or otherwise assuming cardinality instead of ordinality. Two models in particular, the proportional odds and the proportional hazards models are likely to be most useful in practice because of the simplicity of their interpretation. These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are discussed and it is shown that even here the method of iteratively reweighted least squares converges to the maximum likelihood estimate, a property which greatly simplifies the necessary computation. Applications are discussed with the aid of examples.},

The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

It is intended, primarily, for linear micrometrie analysis in petrography, but has similar uses in mineralogy, chemistry, and metallography. Economic applications include the volumetric evaluation of components in building stones, road-metals, sSlid fuels, refractories, and slags.
The object of this new design is to combine speed and accuracy in operation with a particularly compact construction, mechanical simplicity, and strength. Special consideration has been given to the wear and cleansing of bearings, the definition of scale-divisions and zero-marks, and the rigidity of all supports for moving parts.},

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores indicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent periodic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Günzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Giinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.1° C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.8° C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temperature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedimentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years occurred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is necessary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.},

Compared to the former manual methods, the new grid-based statistical calculations are very fast and reproducible. The major aim of this contribution is to help in standardizing the related calculations to enhance the integrity of the Global Land Ice Monitoring from Space (GLIMS) database. The recommendations were prepared by a working group and also contribute to the European Space Agency project GlobGlacier. The document follows the former UNESCO manual for the production of the World Glacier Inventory published in 1970, identifies the potential pitfalls, and describes the differences from the former methods of compilation.

We explain the process of computationally reconstructing three-d imensional (3D) images from 2D radiographs and how to segment the 3D images for subsequent visualization and quantification. Whereas CT is widely used in medical and heavy industrial contexts at relatively low resolutions, here we focus on the application of higher resolution X-r ay CT across science and engineering. We consider the application of X-ray CT to study subjects across the materials, metrology and manufacturing, engineering, food, biological, geological and palaeontological sciences. We examine how CT can be used to follow the structural evolution of materials in three dimensions in real time or in a time-lapse manner, for example to follow materials manufacturing or the in-s ervice behaviour and degradation of manufactured components. Finally, we consider the potential for radiation damage and common sources of imaging artefacts, discuss reproducibility issues and consider future advances and opportunities.},

	abstract = {Volume-area power law scaling, one of a set of analytical scaling techniques based on principals of dimensional analysis, has become an increasingly important and widely used method for estimating the future response of the world’s glaciers and ice caps to environmental change. Over 60 papers since 1988 have been published in the glaciological and environmental change literature containing applications of volume-area scaling, mostly for the purpose of estimating total global glacier and ice cap volume and modeling future contributions to sea level rise from glaciers and ice caps. The application of the theory is not entirely straightforward, however, and many of the recently published results contain analyses that are in conﬂict with the theory as originally described by Bahr et al. (1997). In this review we describe the general theory of scaling for glaciers in full three-dimensional detail without simpliﬁcations, including an improved derivation of both the volume-area scaling exponent γ and a new derivation of the multiplicative scaling parameter c. We discuss some common misconceptions of the theory, presenting examples of both appropriate and inappropriate applications. We also discuss potential future developments in power law scaling beyond its present uses, the relationship between power law scaling and other modeling approaches, and some of the advantages and limitations of scaling techniques.},

The instability observed under a wide variety of experimental conditions has been analyzed, and the initial phases have been found to agree well with the first-order theory given in part I. When the disturbance has attained a considerable amplitude the first-order equations cease to apply and it changes from a wave into a form which has the appearance of large round-ended columns of air extending into the liquid and separated by narrow sheets of liquid. The air columns attain a steady velocity relative to the accelerating liquid and continue to penetrate into the liquid until the lower surface of the liquid is reached. In spite of these very large surface disturbances, the main body of liquid below them is accelerated as though they did not exist.},

	abstract = {We present a large scale (1:10,000) geomorphological map of Favignana Island, in which landforms were recognized and genetically categorized based on analysis of stereoscopic aerial photographs and freely available satellite images, complimented by a few validation tests performed in the ﬁeld. The map was created following the guidelines of the Italian Geomorphological Working Group for landforms symbolic representation. This includes an immediate visual diﬀerentiationof the genetic character and the state of activity of landforms. Favignana, belonging to the Egadi Archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea (SW Italy), is a mid-sized (ca. 20 km2) mostly carbonatic island. The marine protected area surrounding the island represents the main attraction for tourists. Through this map, it was possible to highlight the richness and diversity, in terms of abundance and peculiarity of landforms, that characterizes the Island. This peculiarity makes of Favignana an excellent candidate for the exploitation of its geoheritage for touristic purposes.},

	abstract = {Camera images and video recordings are simple and non-invasive tools to investigate animals in their natural habitat. Quantitative evaluations, however, often require an exact reconstruction of object positions, sizes, and distances in the image. Here, we provide an open source software package to perform such calculations. Our approach allows the user to correct for perspective distortion, transform images to ‘‘bird’s-eye" view projections, or transform image-coordinates to real-world coordinates and vice versa. The extrinsic camera parameters that are necessary to perform such image corrections and transformations (elevation, tilt/roll angle, and heading of the camera) are obtained from the image using contextual information such as a visible horizon, GPS coordinates of landmarks, known object sizes, or images of the same object obtained from different viewing angles. All mathematical operations are implemented in the Python package CameraTransform. The performance of the implementation is evaluated using computer-generated synthetic images with known camera parameters. Moreover, we test our algorithm on images of emperor penguin colonies, and demonstrate that the camera tilt and roll angles can be estimated with an error of less than one degree, and the camera elevation with an error of less than 5\%. The CameraTransform software package simplifies camera matrix-based image transformations and the extraction of quantitative image information. An extensive documentation and usage examples in an ecological context are provided at http://cameratransform.readthedocs.io.},

	abstract = {Background Some authors have proposed different predictive factors of severe acute cholecystitis, but generally, the results of risk analyses are expressed as odds ratios, which makes it difficult to apply in the clinical practice of the acute care surgeon. The severe form of acute cholecystitis should include both gangrenous and phlegmonous cholecystitis, due to their severe clinical course, and cholecystectomy should not be delayed. The aim of this study was to create a nomogram to obtain a graphical tool to compute the probability of having a severe acute cholecystitis.
Methods This is a retrospective study on 393 patients who underwent emergency cholecystectomy between January 2010 and December 2015 at the Acute Care Surgery Service of the S. Anna University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy. Patients were classified as having a non-severe acute cholecystitis or a severe acute cholecystitis (i.e., gangrenous and phlegmonous) based on the final pathology report. The baseline characteristics, pre-operative signs, and abdominal ultrasound (US) findings were assessed with a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the risk of severe acute cholecystitis, and a nomogram was created.
Results Age as a continuous variable, WBC count ≥ 12.4 × 103/μl, CRP ≥9.9 mg/dl, and presence of US thickening of the gallbladder wall were significantly associated with severe acute cholecystitis at final pathology report. A significant interaction between the effect of age and CRP was found. Four risk classes were identified based on the nomogram total points.
Conclusions Patients with a nomogram total point ≥ 74 should be considered at high risk of severe acute cholecystitis (at 74 total point, sensitivity = 78.5\%; specificity = 78.2\%; accuracy = 78.3\%) and this finding could be useful for surgical planning once confirmed in a prospective study comparing the risk score stratification and clinical outcomes.},

This article reviews life-course data analysis methods for modeling these trajectories, as well as their application in studies of antisocial behavior and of crime in childhood, in adolescence, and throughout life. We set the stage by introducing growth curve (hierarchical linear) models. We focus our review on ﬁnite mixture models for life-course data, known as group-based trajectory and growth mixture models. We then discuss how these models are applied within criminology and developmental psychology, recent controversies over their substantive use and interpretation, and important issues of statistical practice and the challenges they raise. Building on the critical literature, we offer several recommendations for the applied users of the models. Finally, we present the most recent method of examining behavioral trajectories in criminology, the unimodal curve registration (UCR) approach. We brieﬂy contrast the UCR model with growth curve and ﬁnite mixture models for life-course data analysis.},

	abstract = {Humans occupy a wider range of environments, process more energy, and have greater biomass than any other species because we are able to culturally evolve complex, locally adaptive technologies.1 Competing models make different predictions about the role of causal knowledge in this process. Some argue that innovation and transmission cannot occur without causal understanding,2–5 while others posit that complex technologies can evolve without causal understanding.1,6–10 Prior research on this topic has been restricted to theoretical work and experimental studies with student participants.11–13 The Hadza are foragers who rely on bows for subsistence.14–16 We interviewed skilled Hadza bowyers (bow-makers) and compared their beliefs regarding the tradeoffs in bow construction to those revealed by experimental and engineering research. If bowyers understand the tradeoffs, it is plausible that cultural evolution is rooted in causal understanding, while if they do not, the cultural accumulation of knowledge is likely more important in the process. We show that Hadza bowyers understand some mechanical trade-offs but not others, and therefore the evolution of a complex, highly adaptive technology is possible with incomplete causal knowledge regarding key mechanical trade-offs. Instead, some important design choices made by subjects seem to reﬂect cultural norms. Although previously published reports have suggested that some individuals are recognized by the Hadza as being especially skilled or knowledgeable,14,17 our results do not indicate that some individuals are significantly more knowledgeable about bow-making than others, nor is there statistical evidence that causal knowledge increases with age.},

	abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of speci®c applications. However, in any speci®c application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the speci®c context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of ®tting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc ®tting, and after calibration the model is used, with the ®tted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the ®tted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-®tting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

Erosional and scattered paleosol evidences beneath the sands are consistent with an emersion interval following the already recognized tectonic phase. The lower part of the "sabbie gialle" formation is locally characterized by a grave1 sandy layer, few cm to 15 m thick, withprominent cherty composition of the well sorted and rounded clasts. It is suggested to limit the use of the term "sabbie gialle" formation to the littoral foreshore to shoreface sandy facies (plus minor heteropic bodies) overlying the unconformity.

We discuss approximations and limitations inherent in the present methodology, and we estimate their contributions to systematic photometric uncertainties. We propose an alternative conceptual scheme for the relative calibration of astronomical apparatus: the availability of calibrated detectors whose relative spectral sensitivity is known to better than one part in 103 opens up the possibility of in situ relative throughput measurements, normalized to a precision calibrated detector, using a stable but uncalibrated narrowband light source. An implementation scheme is outlined, which exploits the availability of tunable lasers to map out the relative wavelength response of an imaging system, using a ﬂat-ﬁeld screen and a calibrated reference photodiode. The merits and limitations of this scheme are discussed. In tandem with careful measurements of atmospheric transmission, this approach could potentially lead to reliable ground-based photometry with fractional uncertainties below the percent level.},

We pay special attention to the spatial structure of the calibration errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses. Applying this to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging data, we achieve ∼ 1\% relative calibration errors across 8500 deg2 in griz; the errors are ∼ 2\% for the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodelled atmospheric variations at Apache Point Observatory.

	abstract = {Radiocarbon dating uses the decay of a radioactive isotope of carbon (14C) to measure time and date objects containing carbon-bearing material. With a half-life of 5,700 ± 30 years, detection of 14C is a useful tool for determining the age of a specimen formed over the past 55,000 years. In this Primer, we outline key advances in 14C measurement and instrument capacity, as well as optimal sample selection and preparation. We discuss data processing, carbon reservoir age correction, calibration and statistical analyses. We then outline examples of radiocarbon dating across a range of applications, from anthropology and palaeoclimatology to forensics and medical science. Reproducibility and minimum reporting standards are discussed along with potential issues related to accuracy and sensitivity. Finally, we look forwards to the adoption of radiocarbon dating in various fields of research thanks to continued instrument improvement.},

Here we present the ﬁrst probabilistic inversion framework capable of inverting both trace and major element data of maﬁc volcanic rocks to constrain mantle potential temperature, depth of melting, and major and trace element source composition. The inversion strategy is based on the combination of (i) a two-phase multicomponent reactive transport model, (ii) a thermodynamic solver for the evolution of major elements and mineral/liquid phases, (iii) a disequilibrium model of trace element partitioning and (iv) an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The mechanical and chemical evolution of melt and solid residue are therefore modelled in an internally- and thermodynamically-consistent manner.},

Rapid saturation of the magnets confirmed evidence from primary mission results that the magnetic mineral in the Martian surface is widely distributed, most probably in the form of composite particles of magnetic and nonmagnetic minerals. (2) An image of the VL 2 backhoe taken via the ?4 magnifying mirror demonstrates the fine-grained nature of the attracted magnetic material. (3) The reference test chart magnet on VL 1, and by inference also on VL 2, continued to attract magnetic particles from the Martian atmosphere. The new results generally are in agreement with previous estimates of 1?7\% of magnetic mineral, probably maghemite, in the surface material. The presence of maghemite and its occurrence as a pigment in, or a thin coating on, all mineral particles or as discrete, finely divided and widely distributed crystallites, are consistent with data from the inorganic analysis experiments and with laboratory simulations of results of the biology experiments on Mars.},

These cracks form networks of interconnected tension fractures arranged in remarkable polygonal patterns. Because tensile stress due to drying declines downwards through the sediment, mud cracks have generally been theorized to nucleate near the surface, propagate downwards, and terminate at depth. Here I trace the nucleation and growth path of natural mud cracks by analyzing in detail crack-surface morphology. The present observations show that systematic nucleation at the bottom of the polygons and upward propagation of mud cracks are much more prevalent than previously postulated. The cracks predominantly rupture the desiccated layers before they significantly extend laterally and sequentially form the polygonal patterns. The consistent location of crack origins at depth, along the bottom of the polygons, strongly suggests that stress concentration at flaw discontinuities and layer boundaries play a fundamental role during mud fracturing.},

It is based on molecular dynamics principles to model interacting particles by numerically solving their equations of motion. Particles represent indivisible units of the system such as grains and interactions are described through effective potential functions. In this initial work, particles interact through radial pairwise potentials and the solid is made of particles arranged in a two–dimensional triangular lattice which corresponds to an isotropic elastic medium in the macroscopic limit. Simple and tractable potentials are specified to model brittle and ductile material. Numerical experiments of flawed brittle and ductile blocks subjected to uni–axial compression yield mode II fracturing behavior and characteristic stress–strain curves. In another experiment involving brittle blocks with rough surfaces being dragged past one another, stick–slip frictional behavior is observed. These results suggest that earthquakes can be simulated using the particle based modeling approaches even when the particles and their interactions are highly simplified.},

Faulting or fracturing between neighbouring elements is represented by a transition from repulsive{\textasciicircum}attractive forces to solely repulsive forces.The sedimentary sequence is mechanically heterogeneous, consisting of intercalated layers of markedly di¡erent strengths and thicknesses.The interlayering of weak and strong layers within the sedimentary rocks promotes the localization of £exural £ow deformation within the weak layers. Even with simple displacement boundary conditions, and straightforward interlayering of weak and strong layers, the structural geometries that develop are complex, with a combination of box, lift- o¡ and disharmonic detachment fold styles forming above the de¤ collement. In detail, it is found that the modelled folds grow by both limb rotation and limb lengthening.The combination of these two mechanisms results in uplift patterns above the folds that are di⁄cult, or misleading, to interpret in terms of simple kinematic models. Comparison of modelling results with natural examples and with kinematic models highlights the complexities of structural interpretation in such settings.},

	abstract = {Powder diffraction is a non-destructive technique, which is experimentally simple in principle. Because the physics behind diffraction is well understood, an exceptionally large amount of information can be obtained from a single measurement. The positions and relative intensities of the peaks yield a fingerprint that can be used for qualitative phase analysis. Quantitative phase analysis can be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensities. Unit cells can be derived from the peak positions. Crystal structures can be solved using powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The peak profiles contain information about crystallite size, strain and nanostructure. Non-idealities in the intensities give information on texture. Abandoning the crystallographic model provides information about local structure, by pair distribution function analysis. For powder diffraction, everything is a sample; the technique is commonly applied to characterize minerals, ceramics, metals and alloys, catalysts, polymers, pharmaceuticals, organic compounds, environmental and forensic samples, among others. The major features of contemporary laboratory powder diffractometers are described. Methods for obtaining suitable powder specimens are summarized. Major applications of qualitative and quantitative phase analysis, structure solution, size/strain/nanostructure analysis using peak profiles, texture analysis and pair distribution function analysis are introduced.},

	abstract = {Geographers and geologists, although not yet constituted as formal professions but already representing two significant sections of the Natural Science Faculty in the University, gave their specialized contributions to the Italian struggle all along World War One. For decades before the war actually started, geographers had conceived and perfected the concept of «natural border» that would make the northern and eastern crests of the Alps the boundary between the Italian cultural area and the areas inhabited by Germans, Slovenians and Croatians. Moreover, geographers contributed to the warfare by publishing political and scientific essays, which would popularize the «natural border» concept to root it into the people during the deals for peace treaties that would follow the partition of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, one of them, Cesare Battisti, who took part to the battle, paid with his life his dedication to recovering Trentino to the homeland. The contribution of geologists to warfare is less clear, because geologists were at that time not yet clearly distinguishable from either geographers or engineers. Therefore, while most geologists mobilized as full members of the Engineering Corps, others contributed as civil temporary aggregates in developing ore production, so that Italy would cope with the enormous deficit, which very large import of essential war materials and foodstuff had created. A typical attempt of making use for export of Italian minerals not easily available to the European allies occurred at Lurisia, near Cuneo. In August 1918 Marie Curie visited the Lurisia site and the Nivolano radioactive waters as a possible source of radium and «émanation» (= radon) to be used in post-war recovery, but lack of industrial interest resulting from careful geological and mineralogical surveys after the war suggested dismissing the mine claim and transforming the Lurisia site into a spa.},

	abstract = {Il presente lavoro di tesi si inquadra nel programma di rilevamento geologico del Foglio 027 Bolzano, nell’area della Val di Tires – Passo Nigra, Alta Val d’Ega (Bolzano), la cui realizzazione è in corso a cura della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano, nell’ambito del progetto CARG.  Durante la campagna di rilevamento sono stati prelevati 33 campioni presso Tires, in Alta Val d’Ega, appartenenti alle vulcaniti permiane del Gruppo Vulcanico Atesino (GVA), 18 dei quali sono stati sottoposti ad analisi ottico-petrografica e chimica in XRF.  I campioni sono stati prelevati dalle tre principali formazioni geologiche affioranti nell’area: la Formazione di Gargazzone (IGG), la Formazione di Cornedo (COR) e la Formazione di Ora (ORA).   Dalle analisi è emerso che i campioni prelevati dalla Formazione di Gargazzone risultano di composizione riodacitica, quelli della Formazione di Cornedo hanno composizione andesitica e andesitico-dacitica, quelli della Formazione di Ora hanno composizione riolitica e riodacitica.  Sono state distinte tre litofacies all’interno della Formazione di Ora: una litofacies basale, caratterizzata da un’elevata concentrazione di componenti litiche; una litofacies intermedia, decisamente più massiccia ed omogenea, che presenta al suo interno sporadici corpi lenticolari di ignimbriti ricche in pomici; una litofacies di tetto, ricca in pomici.  Generalmente le ignimbriti della Formazione di Ora si caratterizzano per la composizione riolitica ricca in sanidino, ma la presenza di ignimbriti di composizione riodacitica all’interno della formazione e precisamente nell’area di studio, si può imputare alla modificazione della composizione mineralogica e chimica originaria a causa dei fenomeni metasomatici, particolarmente intensi lungo il bordo calderico.  Sono stati inoltre prelevati cinque campioni che tagliano le formazioni affioranti, due dei quali hanno composizione riolitica, due hanno composizione basaltica e uno ha composizione alcali-basaltica.},

Diciotto di queste ricadono nella porzione nord orientale del Foglio 27 Bolzano e due nell’adiacente Foglio 14 Bressanone.  I campioni sono stati raccolti durante le campagne di rilevamento effettuate per il Servizio Geologico della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano nell’ambito del progetto CARG.  I campioni studiati sono profondamente affetti da processi metasomatici che hanno modificato sensibilmente la loro composizione. E stato necessario eseguire un accurato confronto fra l’esame petrografico in sezione sottile e le analisi geochimiche (in XRF) per ottenere la classificazione corretta dei campioni. Le analisi effettuate hanno consentito di attribuire i campioni alle formazioni vulcaniche affioranti nel settore settentrionale del Gruppo Vulcanico Atesino.  La sequenza vulcanica è compresa tra due discordanze di primo ordine: quella inferiore sul basamento metamorfico Varisico Sudalpino, mentre quella superiore con i depositi clastici continentali permiani caratterizzati dalla base erosiva delle facies conglomeratiche che costituiscono le Arenarie della Val Gardena (AVG). Escludendo due campioni di arenaria, lo studio e la classificazione geochimica dei prodotti vulcanici hanno evidenziato che tutti i campioni presentano composizioni subalcaline di carattere dacitico, riolitico/ riodacitico. Un solo campione è risultato essere un’andesite.},

Le rocce sono state campionate in sito per essere poi analizzate in laboratorio con diverse tecniche: osservazioni delle sezioni sottili e microanalisi al SEM (microscopio elettronico a scansione).  Sono stati raccolti un totale di otto campioni. Da questi si sono ricavate sette sezioni sottili ed una sezione lucida. Ognuno di questi campioni si è dimostrato molto alterato e tettonizzato, cosa prevedibile già dal rilevamento in campagna dato che la maggior parte delle rocce campionate tendevano molto facilmente a sgretolarsi.  Le rocce si sono dimostrate essere brecce, serpentiniti e basalti.  Osservando le sezioni sottili si è potuto notare che alcuni campioni risultavano completamente impregnati di calcite, in altri i minerali originali (come le olivine e i pirosseni) sono stati totalmente sostituiti e di loro restano a malapena pochi relitti, in altri ancora era presente una diffusa ossidazione.  Dalla microanalisi della sezione di un basalto è emersa la completa albitizzazione dei plagioclasi ed è stata stabilita la natura fondamentalmente augitica dei pirosseni.},

Lo scopo della tesi è studiare le associazioni a foraminiferi presenti all’interno del sondaggio CQ14\_01, prelevato nel Mar Ionio a 3793 m di profondità, nel prisma di accrezione calabro e che presenta una successione riferibile alla HAT dello spessore di circa 7 m.  All’interno della HAT, le analisi micropaleontologiche hanno evidenziato la presenza di una cospicua quantità di foraminiferi bentonici di dimensioni comprese tra 63 e 125 µm, costituite principalmente da specie presenti in un ampio intervallo batimetrico e subordinatamente da taxa tipici di piattaforma interna (principalmente Patellina corrugata, Spirillina vivipara e Rosalina spp.). La presenza di una quantità relativamente abbondante di taxa di piattaforma interna suggerisce che sia stata l'onda di ritorno dello tsunami a innescare la torbidite, mentre l'onda di andata avrebbe prodotto la rimobilizzazione del sedimento di piattaforma. Un simile modello di innesco delle torbiditi legate a tsunami è stato elaborato per spiegare alcune torbiditi messe in posto a seguito dell'evento sismico di Tohoku-Oki del 2011 (Arai et al., 2013). Lo studio eseguito in questa Tesi suggerisce che l’analisi delle associazioni a foraminiferi in depositi torbiditici può costituire uno strumento utile per determinare i paleoambenti di provenienza dei fossili e probabilmente anche per ricostruire le modalità di innesco e di messa in posto dei flussi torbiditici.},

	abstract = {Il sito archeologico di Grotta di Fumane (Verona) riveste un ruolo di rilievo in Europa per via delle numerose e importanti testimonianze sulla vita dei neandertaliani e dei primi Homo sapiens nel Pleistocene superiore. Nello specifico sono stati analizzati i resti malacologici provenienti dai livelli protoaurignaziani e aurignaziani della grotta. Gli obiettivi di questo studio sono: 1) effettuare una revisione tassonomica per le specie di molluschi presenti nella collezione; 2) reperire informazioni sulle attuali aree di approvvigionamento degli stessi e 3) studiarne le caratteristiche morfologiche ed ecologiche al fine di determinare criteri di scelta delle conchiglie e comprenderne l’utilizzo da parte di H. sapiens. A tal fine è stata eseguita una attività di ricerca online tramite i siti “World Register of Marine Species” (WoRMS) e del “Censimento della Malacofauna marina italiana” del Centro ENEA - Santa Teresa (La Spezia), inoltre è stata consultata letteratura specialistica. La revisione tassonomica ha evidenziato che tre specie sul totale hanno attualmente una nomenclatura binomiale differente. Il 91\% delle specie si trova lungo le coste italiane. Circa il 68\% dei ritrovamenti ricadono nei primi 10 metri di profondità (spiaggia). Il 67.7\% circa dei ritrovamenti è stata reperita su fondali prevalentemente rocciosi e coralligeni. Il calcolo della media pesata (per esemplari) delle dimensioni massime delle specie in collezione è di circa 18,5 millimetri. La ricerca sui pattern cromatici dimostra che la maggior parte degli esemplari presenta un pattern cromatico prevalente rosso o rosa (circa il 55,5\%). In conclusione si ritiene che i reperti in collezione siano stati raccolti da H. sapiens in prevalenza su spiagge caratterizzate da substrato prevalentemente roccioso e/o detritico dalle aree del litorale tirrenico o croate ad uso ornamentale. Si ritiene che questo lavoro possa rappresentare un contributo alla conoscenza delle prime società di H. sapiens.},

	abstract = {This thesis focuses on the description of a fossil shark found in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Pavia during a complex restoration project started in 1989. The specimen represents one of the rarest shark taxa from the world–renown Eocene Bolca locality. Unlike the Ypresian taxa Galeorhinus cuvieri and Eogaleus bolcensis, the specimen partly disarticulated and lies in a limestone matrix, suggesting its provenience from the Monte Postale site. The dataset of measurements for body parameters, vertebral centra, teeth and placoid scales was compared to both fossil and extant taxa in order to discuss the overall systematic assessments of the Bolca sharks at higher taxonomic levels. Overall body measurements collected from all Bolca specimens were combine in order to estimate the size of the examined specimen. Statistical approach performed on body measurements and preserved vertebrae support a largely sharing of these characters among the extant taxa of the order Carcharhiniformes. SEM analysis on dermal denticle support that the Pavia specimen is an individual of Eogaleus bolcensis. A comprehensive dataset of teeth was used to compare dental morphologies of the living species Galeorhinus galeus and Galeocerdo cuvier, considered here as standards. The general clustering is primarily based on qualitative characters and ratios between selected measurements. The comparison between fossil and extant taxa based on newly defined tooth morphotypes increase our knowledge on taxonomic identifications of Bolca’s sharks. The morphometrical measurements for each fossil specimen indicates three distinct ontogenetic classes, further supported by estimated ages following standard Von Bertalanffy growth curves. As the present–day Galeocerdo, Eogaleus was most likely a mesopelagic, top predator. The combination of biological and abiotic proxies suggests the Bolca setting as a possible nursery area for the juvenile–schooling individuals of G. cuvieri.},

	abstract = {This thesis has the main aim of defining the lithostratigraphy, depositional architecture, post-depositional modifications and reservoir characteristics of the Cardium Formation in the Ferrier Oilfield, and how these characteristics can have great impact over production rates, GOR and produced fluid discrimination.  In the Ferrier area, the Cardium Formation is composed by a NE prograding clastic sequence made up of offshore to shoreface deposits sealed by marine shales.  The main reservoir is composed by sandstones and conglomerates interpreted to have deposited in a shoreface depositional environment.  Lithofacies and net reservoir thickness mapping led to more detailed understanding of the 3D reservoir architecture, and cross-sections shed light on the Cardium depositional architecture and post-deposition sediment erosion in the Ferrier area.  Detailed core logging, thin section, SEM and CL analyses were used to study the mineralogy, texture and pore characterization of the Cardium reservoir, and three main compartments have been identified based on production data and reservoir characteristics.  Finally, two situations showing odd production behaviour of the Cardium were resolved. This shed light on the effect of structural features and reservoir quality and thickness over hydrocarbon migration pathways.  The Ferrier example offers a unique case of fluid discrimination in clastic reservoirs due both to depositional and post-depositional factors, and could be used as analogue for similar situations in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.},

	abstract = {Nel presente lavoro sono state analizzate le distribuzioni quantitative dei Foraminiferi planctonici e bentonici presenti in una carota e in un box core prelevati nel Mare di Ross in Antartide durante la campagna KOPRI ANTA03 nel Febbraio 2013 nell’ambito del progetto di ricerca congiunto Corea- Italia finanziato dal Progetto Nazionale di Ricerca in Antartide (PNRA). Scopo del lavoro è stato quello di comprendere l’evoluzione ambientale dell’area in base alla distribuzione quantitativa e qualitativa delle associazioni a Foraminiferi nel tardo Quaternario.  In base alla distribuzione quantitativa dei Foraminiferi identificati, la sequenza sedimentaria della carota C2 è stata suddivisa in tre intervalli corrispondenti a tre principali fasi paleoceanografiche/paleoclimatiche. La prima fase, più antica di 18 ka, caratterizzata dall’assenza o rarità di forme documenta un ambiente con presenza di copertura glaciale. La seconda, depositatasi tra 18 ka e {\textasciitilde}8 ka è caratterizzata da una maggiore variabilità intraspecifica e riflette un miglioramento delle condizioni climatiche. La terza, corrisponde ad un periodo compreso tra {\textasciitilde}8 ka e {\textasciitilde}2 ka. La presenza di forme agglutinanti e l’assenza di Foraminiferi a guscio calcareo suggeriscono la presenza di condizioni di dissoluzione carbonatica sul fondale in un ambiente marino libero da copertura glaciale. La documentazione di numerosi individui allo stadio giovanile di Neogloboquadrina pachyderma durante l’intervallo B ha reso possibile avanzare ipotesi riguardo la strategia di sopravvivenza di questa specie in ambiente estremo quale il ghiaccio antartico. La somiglianza morfologica tra individui giovanili di Neogloboquadrina pachyderma riscontrata durante il nostro studio nei sedimenti a livello fossile nella carota con individui giovanili della stessa specie provenienti da campioni di ghiaccio marino antartico documentati in bibliografia, ha permesso di supportare la tesi dello sviluppo di tali forme nei pori del “microghiaccio”.},

Tramite i dati forniti da strumenti geofisici, quali l’ecoscandaglio a fascio multiplo (Multibeam) e i profili sismici Chirp Sub-bottom, è stato possibile lo studio di tali elementi e la redazione di due mappe che riportano le isobate delle profondità della superficie di massima ingressione marina e degli isospessori del cuneo olocenico di stazionamento alto. I depositi, nel corso del lavoro, sono stati suddivisi per facilitare la loro descrizione. L'analisi dei depositi trasgressivi ha permesso il riconoscimento di elementi morfologici quali frecce litorali (spit), isole barriera (barrier island), sistemi barriera-laguna e un sistema deltizio sommerso. Queste elementi sono stati ricondotti dunque ad una piattaforma relitta, ormai sommersa, le cui morfologie sono state plasmate dall'ultima trasgressione marina. Grazie ai profili chirp subbottom è stato inoltre possibile riconoscere un basamento carbonatico Meso-Cenozoico con un area di 23 km². I depositi olocenici di stazionamento alto occupano circa l'88\% della superficie della piattaforma analizzata. Gli spessori maggiori, corrispondenti a 25m, sono stati riscontrati in prossimità della costa da cui degradano verso nord fino ad estinguersi. L'estensione del cuneo olocenico risulta essere influenzata dalle correnti, che trasportano i sedimenti verso est, dalla presenza degli alti morfologici, in prossimità della cui superficie i sedimenti si arrestano, e dall'apporto fluviale fornito dalle fiumare che sfociano nella zona analizzata.  Quest'ultimo è il fattore che influenza maggiormente lo spessore del cuneo. Nelle aree di piattaforma prossime alle foci fluviali inoltre è stata riscontrata la deposizione di materiali grossolani che lateralmente sfumano a fini attraverso contatti eteropici.},

L'origine di queste mineralizzazioni va ricercato nello stadio idrotermale del processo di raffreddamento del magma e nel caso della zona di studio più precisamente va ricondotto al raffreddamento del Plutone di Porto Azzurro. L’obiettivo di questa tesi, quindi, è quello di tentare di formulare almeno due modelli concettuali, i quali siano in grado di spiegare come si sono formate parte delle suddette mineralizzazioni di natura idrotermale e, al tempo stesso, comprendere meglio quali processi fisici, chimici e geologici sono entrati in gioco. Infine, le osservazioni puntuali all’affioramento ed al microscopio su campioni chiave raccolti nella zona studiata sono utilizzate per discriminare le fasi deformative collegate ai fluidi, ordinare cronologicamente le fasi deformative avvenute e, quindi, cercare di inquadrare la faglia Topinetti nel contesto evolutivo geodinamico degli Appennini settentrionali.},

Tuttavia non vi sono studi strutturali che correlino la geometria e la cinematica delle strutture contenenti i cristalli (prevalentemente fratture dilatanti ed ibride) con le mineralizzazioni. Oltre a uno studio di carattere strutturale mirato a chiarire l’eventuale controllo esercitato dalla storia deformativa locale sulla cristallizzazione del quarzo, si è deciso altresì di studiare le inclusioni fluide presenti in alcuni cristalli. Il rilevamento di terreno presso Case Calistri (BO) ha permesso l’individuazione di una correlazione fra la direzione delle fratture e la mineralizzazione. Lo studio delle inclusioni fluide ha permesso invece di stimare la temperatura di intrappolamento delle inclusioni. Infine è stata ricostruita una storia deformativa locale che prevede due eventi distinti, un primo evento trascorrente seguito da uno estensionale, seguiti dalla circolazione di almeno due generazioni di fluidi.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to develop 3D geological models employ a mix of quantitative and qualitative scientiﬁc techniques, which do not fully provide quantiﬁcation of uncertainty in the constructed models and fail to optimally weight geological ﬁeld observations against constraints from geophysical data. Here, using the Bayesian Obsidian software package, we develop a methodology to fuse lithostratigraphic ﬁeld observations with aeromagnetic and gravity data to build a 3D model in a small (13.5 km Â 13.5 km) region of the Gascoyne Province, Western Australia. Our approach is validated by comparing 3D model results to independently-constrained geological maps and cross-sections produced by the Geological Survey of Western Australia. By fusing geological ﬁeld data with aeromagnetic and gravity surveys, we show that 89\% of the modelled region has {\textgreater}95\% certainty for a particular geological unit for the given model and data. The boundaries between geological units are characterized by narrow regions with {\textless}95\% certainty, which are typically 400–1000 m wide at the Earth’s surface and 500–2000 m wide at depth. Beyond {\textasciitilde}4 km depth, the model requires geophysical survey data with longer wavelengths (e.g., active seismic) to constrain the deeper subsurface. Although Obsidian was originally built for sedimentary basin problems, there is reasonable applicability to deformed terranes such as the Gascoyne Province. Ultimately, modiﬁcation of the Bayesian engine to incorporate structural data will aid in developing more robust 3D models. Nevertheless, our results show that surface geological observations fused with geophysical survey data can yield reasonable 3D geological models with narrow uncertainty regions at the surface and shallow subsurface, which will be especially valuable for mineral exploration and the development of 3D geological models under cover.},

The authors further separate the term ‘‘visible’’ into ‘‘simple detection’’ or ‘‘detectability’’ and ‘‘clear identiﬁcation’’ or ‘‘identiﬁability’’ and point out that the Koschmieder model is applicable to identiﬁability, but not necessarily for detectability. In addition, the way of calculating contrast is revised to follow the concept of brightness constancy.

Focusing on scenario and parametric uncertainty, we show that mean predicted maximum doses to humans on the earth's surface due to 1-129, and uncertainty bands around those predictions, are larger when scenario uncertainty is properly assessed and propagated.

	abstract = {A typical geostatistical analysis of soil data proceeds on the assumption that the properties of interest are the outcomes of random processes. Is the assumption reasonable? Many factors have contributed to the soil as we see it, both in the parent material and during its formation. Each has a physical cause, each must obey the laws of physics, and each is in principle deterministic except at the sub-atomic level. The outcome must therefore be deterministic. Yet such is the complexity of the factors in combination, their variation over the time, and the incompleteness of our knowledge, that the outcome, the soil, appears to us as if it were random. Only when we see the results of man’s activities, such as the division of the land into fields, the imposition of irrigation, and ditches for drainage, do we recognize organized control. Clearly, the soil is not random, but except in the latter instances we are unlikely to go far wrong if we assume that it is. A second assumption underlying many geostatistical analyses is that of stationarity. We might ask if this holds. In the real world, we have ever only one realization of the random process in a particular region, and so the question has no answer. We can look to see whether regional averages are the same when we move from region to region. This means treating data from different regions as if they were different realizations of the same generating process. We should therefore change our question to ‘is a stationary model of the soil realistic?’ We can then examine the reality against the assumptions of our model. The soil is neither random nor stationary, but our models of it may be one or other or both. We should therefore ask whether our models are reasonable in the circumstances and whether they are profitable in leading to accurate predictions. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our approach applies not only to fixed dimension problems, but also to variable dimension problems, in which the number of cells in the tessellation is unknown. We illustrate our methods with two real examples. The first relates to reconstructing animal territories, represented by the individual cells of a tessellation, from observation of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. The second example involves the analysis of an image of a cross-section through a sample of metal, with the tessellation modelling the micro-crystalline structure of the metal.},

The assumption that spatial observations can be treated as a stochastic process is judged to be an inappropriate model for natural data. Problems of semivariogram formulation are reviewed, and this method is considered to be inadequate for estimating the function being sought. Characteristics of bivariate interpolation are summarized, highlighting kriging limitations as an interpolation method. Limitations are similar to those of inverse distance weighted observations interpolation. Attention is drawn to the local bias of kriging and misplaced claims that it is an "optimal" interpolation method. The so-called "estimation variance, " interpreted as providing confidence limits for estimation of mining blocks, is shown to be meaningless as an index of local variation. The claim that geostatistics constitutes a "new science" is examined in detail. Such novelties as exist in the method are shown to transgress accepted principles of scientific inference. Stochastic modeling in general is discussed, and purposes of the approach emphasized. For the purpose of detailed quantitative assessment it can provide only prediction qualified by hypothesis at best. Such an approach should play no part in ore deposit assessment where the need is for local detailed inventories; these can only be achieved properly through local deterministic methods, where prediction is purely deductive.},

However, there have, so far, been few applications of geostatistics in archaeology. This paper seeks to highlight some of the key tools provided by geostatistics and to show, through two case studies, how they may be employed in archaeological applications.

	abstract = {Abundant literature has been produced for the last two decades about multiple-point statistics simulation, or MPS. The idea behind MPS is very simple: reproduce patterns from a 2D, or most often a 3D, training image that displays the type of geological heterogeneity deemed to be relevant to the reservoir or ﬁeld under study, while honoring local data. Replicating an image is a traditional computer science problem. Thus, it should come as no surprise if a growing number of publications on MPS borrow ideas and techniques directly from computer vision and machine learning to improve the reproduction of training patterns. However, quoting Andre Journel, “Geostatistics is not about generating pretty pictures.” Models have a purpose. For example, in oil and gas applications, reservoir models are used to estimate hydrocarbon volumes and book reserves, run ﬂow simulations to forecast hydrocarbon production and ultimate recovery, and make decisions about ﬁeld development or optimal well drilling locations. Speciﬁc key features such as the extent and connectivity of shale barriers may have a major impact on the reservoir performance forecasts and the ﬁeld development decisions to be made. Those key features that need to be captured in the model, along with the available subsurface data and constraints of the project, should be the primary drivers in selecting the most appropriate modeling techniques and options to obtain reliable results and make sound decisions. In this paper, the practitioners’ point of view is used to evaluate alternative MPS implementations and highlight remaining gaps.},

Several target areas were chosen at selected locations around the spacecraft, and photometric measurements were taken with the television camera throughout the lunar day. Surveyor I data agree within ±20\% with the terrestrially observed photometric properties. Initial examination of the data indicates no anomalies of the photometric properties of homogeneous areas on scales greater than 6 cm in diameter. Luminance factors were estimated from the observed data and ranged from 7.0\% to 7.5\% for more than 91\% of the area; however, values of 5\% to 25\% were recorded in some locations. The chromaticity coordinates of the disturbed area near one of the footpads were found to be very close to natural sunlight on a gray paint. A preliminary estimate of the spectral radiance factor of this area is given, using an eigenvector-analysis technique. The spacecraft characteristics, viewing geometry, and ground-recording techniques are included, along with a brief description of errors.},

We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The ®rst concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Paci®c island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process Sx, observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of Sxi  appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of Sx, making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

This work aims to identify operational parameters specifically conceived for the classification of marble tiles. In this specific case the meaningful aesthetical properties are mainly linked to the anisotropy of the RGB intensities and, specifically, to the “veins”. Starting from the classical geostatistical and morphological modelling (variograms, granulometries, etc.), specific operational parameters have been obtained for a quantitative measurement of veins density, colour, and geometrical features (width, shape, continuity, etc.). The actual methodology defines commercial categories on the base of a self-appraisal process, which identifies intervals of several parameters. The current procedure is too rigid and doesn’t allow choosing in an intuitive way the discriminating properties. The proposed approach identifies understandable characteristics (vein features), and proposes quantitative indexes which actually satisfy the commercial classification of marbles.},

	abstract = {Definitions of soil particle sphericity, roundness and roughness have existed since at least the 1930s. In the 1950s, charts of typical sphericity and roundness values were developed to alleviate tedious manual determination. They allowed users to classify particles by visual comparison to typical particles possessing ranges of sphericity and roundness. The original definitions and somewhat subjective chart methods are still widely used today. This paper describes robust numerical methods based on computational geometry to determine precisely the traditional values from two-dimensional images of particles. Statistical methods including locally weighted regression and K-fold cross-validation were used to discretise a mean particle surface and thereby quantify and remove roughness. The paper details the algorithms for identifying particle corners and fitting circles to them for computation of roundness. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the most appropriate definition for particle sphericity from among five that are commonly cited. Finally, recommendations are made for the minimum image resolutions and particle perimeter discretisation necessary to obtain accurate results.},

Although the benefits of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the field closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

Dynamic aspects of the model are examined in the context of an explicit knowledge formalism, integrating geostatistical knowledge, symbolic non-algorithmic techniques for knowledge-information representation and inference, and standard numerical data processing.

Cryoconite samples were collected before (12 samples) and after (5 samples) a rainfall event, after which 7 cryoconite holes dissapeared. The concentrations of radionuclides in cryoconite samples from the Blåisen Glacier are compared with data from the Arctic and Alpine glaciers. Cryoconite samples from the studied glacier had extremely high activity concentrations of 137Cs, 241Am, 207Bi and 239+240Pu (up to 25,000 Bq/kg, 58 Bq/kg, 13 Bq/kg and 131 Bq/kg, respectively) and also high concentrations of organic matter (OM), comparing to other Scandinavian and Arctic glaciers, reaching up to {\textasciitilde}40\% of total mass. The outstandingly high concentrations of 137Cs, 241Am, Pu isotopes, and 207Bi on the Blåisen Glacier are primarily related to bioaccumulation of radionuclides in organic-rich cryoconite and might be enhanced by additional transfers of contamination from the tundra by lemmings during their population peaks. The presumed inﬂuence of intense rainfall on radionuclide concentrations in the cryoconite was not conﬁrmed.},

We assess the effect of pneumonia on horn size in male bighorn sheep using 12 herd datasets from across the western United States that had horn growth and disease data. Disease resulted in 12–35\% reduction in increment (yearly) length and 3–13\% reduction in total horn length in exposed individuals. The disease effect was prolonged when pathogens continued to circulate in sheep populations. Further, disease likely delays the age at which horns reach ¾‐curl and prevents achievement of full‐curl. This is further evidenced with 6 of the 12 herds experiencing an increase in average age at harvest following die‐off events.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of tectonics on surface processes and the resultant stratigraphic evolution in multi-phase rifts is challenging, as patterns of erosion and deposition related to older phases of extension are overprinted by the subsequent extensional phases. In this study, we use a one-way coupled numerical modelling approach between a tectonic and a surface processes model to investigate topographic evolution, erosion and basin stratigraphy during single and multi-phase rifting. We compare the results from the single and the multi-phase rift experiments for a 5 Myr period during which they experience equal amounts of extension, but with the multi-phase experiment experiencing fault topography inherited from a previous phase of extension. Our results demonstrate a very dynamic evolution of the drainage network that occurs in response to fault growth and linkage and to depocentre overfilling and overspilling. We observe profound differences between topographic and depocenter development during single and multi-phase rifting with implications for sedimentary facies architecture. Our quantitative approach, enables us to better understand the impact of changing extension direction on the distribution of sediment source areas and the syn-rift stratigraphic development through time and space.},
