## Il campo magnetico terrestre

> In fact, the mechanism that produces Earth's magnetic field is only vaguely understood.

[HR, paragrafo 32-4 MAGNETS]

> Earth's Magnetic Field: Earth's magnetic field is generated in the outer core: 
> convective circulation within the conductive liquid iron and nickel outer core, 
> spiraling in line with Earthâ€™s rotational axis, induces the magnetic field
> of our planet through what is sometimes called a geodynamo.
> Most geophysicists think that for such a geodynamo to work, the presence of an 
> initial weak magnetic ield was needed, most likely coming from the Sun.

> (b) Origin of the main field. Spherical harmonic 
> analysis of the observed magnetic field shows that 
> over 99% is due to sources inside the Earth. The 
> present theory is that the main field is caused by 
> convection currents of conducting material circulating 
> in the liquid outer core (which extends from 
> depths of 2,800 to 5,000 km). The Earth's core is 
> assumed to be a mixture of iron and nickel, both 
> good electrical conductors. The magnetic source is 
> thought to be a self-excited dynamo in which highly 
> conductive fluid moves in a complex manner caused 
> by convection. Paleomagnetic data show that the 
> magnetic field has always been roughly along the 
> Earth's spin axis, implying that the convective motion 
> is coupled to the Earth's spin. Recent exploration 
> of the magnetic fields of other planets and 
> their satellites provide fascinating comparisons with 
> the Earth's field.
