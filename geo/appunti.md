## Il campo magnetico terrestre

> In fact, the mechanism that produces Earth's magnetic field is only vaguely understood.

[HR, paragrafo 32-4 MAGNETS]

> Earth's Magnetic Field: Earth's magnetic field is generated in the outer core: 
> convective circulation within the conductive liquid iron and nickel outer core, 
> spiraling in line with Earthâ€™s rotational axis, induces the magnetic field
> of our planet through what is sometimes called a geodynamo.
> Most geophysicists think that for such a geodynamo to work, the presence of an 
> initial weak magnetic ield was needed, most likely coming from the Sun.

> (b) Origin of the main field. Spherical harmonic 
> analysis of the observed magnetic field shows that 
> over 99% is due to sources inside the Earth. The 
> present theory is that the main field is caused by 
> convection currents of conducting material circulating 
> in the liquid outer core (which extends from 
> depths of 2,800 to 5,000 km). The Earth's core is 
> assumed to be a mixture of iron and nickel, both 
> good electrical conductors. The magnetic source is 
> thought to be a self-excited dynamo in which highly 
> conductive fluid moves in a complex manner caused 
> by convection. Paleomagnetic data show that the 
> magnetic field has always been roughly along the 
> Earth's spin axis, implying that the convective motion 
> is coupled to the Earth's spin. Recent exploration 
> of the magnetic fields of other planets and 
> their satellites provide fascinating comparisons with 
> the Earth's field.

[Chapman, capitolo 8]

> The generation of a global magnetic field requires a rotating, electrically conducting
> shell within a planet as well as fluid motion, i.e. convection, within that shell.
> In the terrestrial planets and satellites this region is believed to be the iron-rich
> fluid core.

[Rossi, paragrafo 10.3.1 Dynamo Generation]

> the field is regarded as 
> the product of electrical currents generated by motion (a sort of
> self-sustaining dynamo) within the fluid outer core.

[TY, capitolo 2]

> The present magnetic field could not be a remnant of an ancient process, a dynamo continuously
> operating is necessary. Briefly this dynamo can be assumed to operate through a distortion 
> and amplification of an initial magnetic field due to a magnetohydrodynamic
> interaction with the motions of the plasma constituting the fluid Earth's core. 
> The field so generated decays with time, owing to ohmic dissipation in the conductor. 
> For its maintenance it is then necessary to hypothesize its continuous regeneration 
> to the detriment of some other forms of energy.
