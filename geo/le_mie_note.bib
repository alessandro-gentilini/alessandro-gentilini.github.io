	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in ﬁtting a model to data, using as an example the ﬁt of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares ﬁtting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being ﬁt. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent ﬁtting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are “nuisance parameters” to marginalize away.},

Several geometric applications are given. In particular, (1) Ricci flow, considered on the space of riemannian metrics modulo diffeomorphism and scaling, has no nontrivial periodic orbits (that is, other than fixed points); (2) In a region, where singularity is forming in finite time, the injectivity radius is controlled by the curvature; (3) Ricci flow can not quickly turn an almost euclidean region into a very curved one, no matter what happens far away. We also verify several assertions related to Richard Hamilton's program for the proof of Thurston geometrization conjecture for closed three-manifolds, and give a sketch of an eclectic proof of this conjecture, making use of earlier results on collapsing with local lower curvature bound.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores indicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent periodic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Günzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Giinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.1° C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.8° C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temperature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedimentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years occurred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is necessary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.},

The algorithm decouples the problem of “relative” calibrations from that of “absolute” calibrations; the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire survey. We pay special attention to the spatial structure of the calibration errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses. Applying this to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging data, we achieve ∼ 1\% relative calibration errors across 8500 deg2 in griz; the errors are ∼ 2\% for the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodelled atmospheric variations at Apache Point Observatory. These calibrations, dubbed “ubercalibration”, are now public with SDSS Data Release 6, and will be a part of subsequent SDSS data releases.},

Rapid saturation of the magnets confirmed evidence from primary mission results that the magnetic mineral in the Martian surface is widely distributed, most probably in the form of composite particles of magnetic and nonmagnetic minerals. (2) An image of the VL 2 backhoe taken via the ?4 magnifying mirror demonstrates the fine-grained nature of the attracted magnetic material. (3) The reference test chart magnet on VL 1, and by inference also on VL 2, continued to attract magnetic particles from the Martian atmosphere. The new results generally are in agreement with previous estimates of 1?7\% of magnetic mineral, probably maghemite, in the surface material. The presence of maghemite and its occurrence as a pigment in, or a thin coating on, all mineral particles or as discrete, finely divided and widely distributed crystallites, are consistent with data from the inorganic analysis experiments and with laboratory simulations of results of the biology experiments on Mars.},

It is based on molecular dynamics principles to model interacting particles by numerically solving their equations of motion. Particles represent indivisible units of the system such as grains and interactions are described through effective potential functions. In this initial work, particles interact through radial pairwise potentials and the solid is made of particles arranged in a two–dimensional triangular lattice which corresponds to an isotropic elastic medium in the macroscopic limit. Simple and tractable potentials are specified to model brittle and ductile material. Numerical experiments of flawed brittle and ductile blocks subjected to uni–axial compression yield mode II fracturing behavior and characteristic stress–strain curves. In another experiment involving brittle blocks with rough surfaces being dragged past one another, stick–slip frictional behavior is observed. These results suggest that earthquakes can be simulated using the particle based modeling approaches even when the particles and their interactions are highly simplified.},

Faulting or fracturing between neighbouring elements is represented by a transition from repulsive{\textasciicircum}attractive forces to solely repulsive forces.The sedimentary sequence is mechanically heterogeneous, consisting of intercalated layers of markedly di¡erent strengths and thicknesses.The interlayering of weak and strong layers within the sedimentary rocks promotes the localization of £exural £ow deformation within the weak layers. Even with simple displacement boundary conditions, and straightforward interlayering of weak and strong layers, the structural geometries that develop are complex, with a combination of box, lift- o¡ and disharmonic detachment fold styles forming above the de¤ collement. In detail, it is found that the modelled folds grow by both limb rotation and limb lengthening.The combination of these two mechanisms results in uplift patterns above the folds that are di⁄cult, or misleading, to interpret in terms of simple kinematic models. Comparison of modelling results with natural examples and with kinematic models highlights the complexities of structural interpretation in such settings.},

	abstract = {A typical geostatistical analysis of soil data proceeds on the assumption that the properties of interest are the outcomes of random processes. Is the assumption reasonable? Many factors have contributed to the soil as we see it, both in the parent material and during its formation. Each has a physical cause, each must obey the laws of physics, and each is in principle deterministic except at the sub-atomic level. The outcome must therefore be deterministic. Yet such is the complexity of the factors in combination, their variation over the time, and the incompleteness of our knowledge, that the outcome, the soil, appears to us as if it were random. Only when we see the results of man’s activities, such as the division of the land into fields, the imposition of irrigation, and ditches for drainage, do we recognize organized control. Clearly, the soil is not random, but except in the latter instances we are unlikely to go far wrong if we assume that it is. A second assumption underlying many geostatistical analyses is that of stationarity. We might ask if this holds. In the real world, we have ever only one realization of the random process in a particular region, and so the question has no answer. We can look to see whether regional averages are the same when we move from region to region. This means treating data from different regions as if they were different realizations of the same generating process. We should therefore change our question to ‘is a stationary model of the soil realistic?’ We can then examine the reality against the assumptions of our model. The soil is neither random nor stationary, but our models of it may be one or other or both. We should therefore ask whether our models are reasonable in the circumstances and whether they are profitable in leading to accurate predictions. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We show how distributions over this class of ‘deformed’ tessellations can be used to define prior distributions for models based on tessellations, and how inference for such models can be carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods; stability properties of the algorithms are investigated. Our approach applies not only to fixed dimension problems, but also to variable dimension problems, in which the number of cells in the tessellation is unknown. We illustrate our methods with two real examples. The first relates to reconstructing animal territories, represented by the individual cells of a tessellation, from observation of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. The second example involves the analysis of an image of a cross-section through a sample of metal, with the tessellation modelling the micro-crystalline structure of the metal.},

Although the benefits of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the field closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

This study attempted to quanti{\textasciitilde}, the effect of such individual differences on the quality of geostatistical spatial estimates. Identical spatial data sets were sent to 12 investigators, who independen@ analyzed the data and produced spatial interpolations. The results varied considerably. Differences in the interpolations could be attributed to differences in choice of methodology, differences in data interpretation, and, in a few cases, errors in procedure. The potential differences in economic and societal costs between decisions based on "good" vs. "'bad" interpolations warrant a systematic approach to the identification and testing of interpolation methods.},

This is not in spite of, but partially based on the famous results of Gödel and Turing. In this way statements are about mathematical objects
              and
              algorithms, proofs show the correctness of statements
              and
              computations, and computations are dealing with objects
              and
              proofs. Interactive computer systems for a full integration of defining, computing and proving are based on this. The human defines concepts, constructs algorithms and provides proofs, while the machine checks that the definitions are well formed and the proofs and computations are correct. Results formalized so far demonstrate the feasibility of this ‘computer mathematics’. Also there are very good applications. The challenge is to make the systems more mathematician-friendly, by building libraries and tools. The eventual goal is to help humans to learn, develop, communicate, referee and apply mathematics.},

Yet, how these traits respond to emerging threats like infectious disease remains underexplored. Infectious pneumonia threatens bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations across North America and we hypothesized it may also reduce horn growth in male sheep. We assess the effect of pneumonia on horn size in male bighorn sheep using 12 herd datasets from across the western United States that had horn growth and disease data. Disease resulted in 12–35\% reduction in increment (yearly) length and 3–13\% reduction in total horn length in exposed individuals. The disease effect was prolonged when pathogens continued to circulate in sheep populations. Further, disease likely delays the age at which horns reach ¾‐curl and prevents achievement of full‐curl. This is further evidenced with 6 of the 12 herds experiencing an increase in average age at harvest following die‐off events.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of tectonics on surface processes and the resultant stratigraphic evolution in multi-phase rifts is challenging, as patterns of erosion and deposition related to older phases of extension are overprinted by the subsequent extensional phases. In this study, we use a one-way coupled numerical modelling approach between a tectonic and a surface processes model to investigate topographic evolution, erosion and basin stratigraphy during single and multi-phase rifting. We compare the results from the single and the multi-phase rift experiments for a 5 Myr period during which they experience equal amounts of extension, but with the multi-phase experiment experiencing fault topography inherited from a previous phase of extension. Our results demonstrate a very dynamic evolution of the drainage network that occurs in response to fault growth and linkage and to depocentre overfilling and overspilling. We observe profound differences between topographic and depocenter development during single and multi-phase rifting with implications for sedimentary facies architecture. Our quantitative approach, enables us to better understand the impact of changing extension direction on the distribution of sediment source areas and the syn-rift stratigraphic development through time and space.},

	abstract = {Ignimbrites within calderas host intrusions with hazardous and/or economically signiﬁcant hydrothermal systems. The Hvítserkur ignimbrite at Breiðavík caldera, north-eastern Iceland, is intruded by basaltic dykes. The country rock ignimbrite is generally soft and zeolite-rich, has low permeability, high porosity, and few macrofractures. However, the ignimbrite immediately adjacent to the dyke is hard, recrystallised quartz, plagioclase, and alkali feldspar, with a low permeability and porosity and frequent macrofractures. At 1–2 m from the dyke, the ignimbrite is hard, dominantly glassy with pervasive perlitic microfractures, has high permeability, but low porosity and frequent macrofractures. A narrow zone of pervasive unlithiﬁed clay exists 2 m from the dyke. The dyke intrusion promoted a narrow zone of welding, fracturing, and perlitisation in the ignimbrite resulting in high permeability and focussed alteration. Our study shows how intrusions and their thermal aureoles create vertical pathways for, and horizontal barriers to, geothermal ﬂuid ﬂow.},

However, despite this being a frequently encountered situation in emergency departments, there is no comprehensive algorithm to manage and follow these patients in the current literature. The purposes of this study were to describe the most commonly used ring removal techniques and to establish an algorithm for the removal of rings trapped on ﬁngers. We performed a comprehensive literature search in several databases to identify all articles, case reports, letters, and book chapters that focus on ring removal techniques in English language from 1960 to the present. There are 2 methods of removal: (1) noncutting techniques in which the rings can be removed without breaking the integrity of the ring and (2) various ring-cutting equipments and tools. All these techniques are classiﬁed into distinct groups and described in detail with illustrations. Furthermore, an algorithm for handling such patients is established according to case-based patient care. Following an algorithm for the removal of trapped rings on the ﬁnger will be useful for patients and emergency physicians. It will also prevent possible complications and will save time.},

These are (1) the rotation matrix, (2) a triple of Euler angles, and (3) the unit quaternion. To these we add a fourth, the rotation vector, which has many of the beneﬁts of both Euler angles and quaternions, but neither the singularities of the former, nor the quadratic constraint of the latter. There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described. Our exposition is catered to those who seek a thorough and uniﬁed reference on the whole subject; detailed derivations of some results are not presented.},

Even more popular is the use of unit quaternions torepresent an object’s attitude. Using unit quaternions torepresent the attitude of an object completely avoids theproblem of gimbal lock. Unit quaternions also have severalother notable advantages that will be discussed in Sec. 6.The main disadvantage of unit quaternions, however, isthat they are constrained to have unit length, a constraint,that while inconsequential in many cases, can lead to com-plications when attempting to optimize over the quater-nion parameters. This is due to the fact that a unity normconstraint is quadratic in form and thus impossible to in-clude in most standard optimization techniques

In this work, a novel graph-based solution to the image anomaly detection problem is proposed; leveraging the graph Fourier transform, we are able to overcome some of RXD’s limitations while reducing computational cost at the same time. Tests over both hyperspectral and medical images, using both synthetic and real anomalies, prove the proposed technique is able to obtain signiﬁcant gains over performance by other algorithms in the state of the art.},

Owing to their unique combination of ﬂexibility, mathematical simplicity and comparative robustness, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such datasets. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and ﬂexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

However, it is neither logically nor statistically correct to conclude an effect is absent when a hypothesis test is not significant. We present two methods to evaluate the presence or absence of effects: Equivalence testing (based on frequentist statistics) and Bayes factors (based on Bayesian statistics). In four examples from the gerontology literature, we illustrate different ways to specify alternative models that can be used to reject the presence of a meaningful or predicted effect in hypothesis tests. We provide detailed explanations of how to calculate, report, and interpret Bayes factors and equivalence tests. We also discuss how to design informative studies that can provide support for a null model or for the absence of a meaningful effect. The conceptual differences between Bayes factors and equivalence tests are discussed, and we also note when and why they might lead to similar or different inferences in practice. It is important that researchers are able to falsify predictions or can quantify the support for predicted null effects. Bayes factors and equivalence tests provide useful statistical tools to improve inferences about null effects.},

The images must experience extraordinary optical deformations due to the deflection of light rays produced by the strong curvature of the space-time in the vicinity. General relativity allows the calculation of such effects, both on a surrounding accretion disk and on the background star field.

	abstract = {When Ötzi, the Iceman, was found in a gully in the Tisenjoch pass in the Tyrolean Alps in 1991, he was a huge surprise for the archaeological community. The lead initial investigator of the find argued that it was unique, preserved by serendipitous circumstances. It was hypothesised that the mummy with associated artefacts had been quickly covered by glacier ice and stayed buried until the melt-out in 1991. It is now more than 30 years since Ötzi appeared. In this paper, we take a closer look at how the find can be understood today, benefitting from increased knowledge gained from more than two decades of investigations of other glacial archaeological sites, and from previous palaeo-biological investigations of the find assemblage. In the light of radiocarbon dates from the gully and new glaciological evidence regarding mass balance, it is likely that Ötzi was not permanently buried in ice immediately after his death, but that the gully where he lay was repeatedly exposed over the next 1500 years. We discuss the nature of the ice covering the site, which is commonly described as a basally sliding glacier. Based on the available evidence, this ice is better understood as a non-moving, stationary field of snow and ice, frozen to the bedrock. The damaged artefacts found with Ötzi were probably broken by typical postdepositional processes on glacial archaeological sites, and not, as previously claimed, during conflict prior to Ötzi’s flight from the valley below.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We analyze the problem of calculating high-frequency ground motions (\&gt;1 Hz) caused by earthquakes having arbitrary spatial variations of rupture velocity and slip velocity (or stress drop) over the fault. We approximate the elastic wave Green's functions by far-field body waves, which we calculate using geometric ray theory. However, we do not make the traditional Fraunhofer approximation, so our method may be used close to large faults. The method is confined to high frequencies (greater than about 1 Hz) due to the omisson of near-field terms, and must be used at source-observer distances less than a few source depths, due to the omission of surface waves. It is easily used in laterally varying velocity structures. Assuming a simple parameterization of the slip function, the computational problem collapses to the evaluation of a series of line integrals over the fault, with one line integral per each time ti in the observer seismogram. The path of integration corresponding to observation time ti consists of only those points on the fault which radiate body waves arriving at the observer at exactly time ti. This path is an isochron of the arrival time function. An isochron velocity may be defined that depends on rupture velocity and resembles the usual directivity function. Observed ground motions are directly dependent upon this isochron velocity. Ground velocity is proportional to isochron velocity and ground acceleration is proportional to isochron acceleration in dislocation models of rupture. Ground acceleration may also be related to spatial variations of slip velocity on the fault, using the square of isochron velocity as a constant of proportionality. We show two rupture models, one with variable slip velocity and the other with variable rupture velocity, that cause the same ground acceleration at a single observer. The computational method is shown to produce reasonably accurate synthetic seismograms, compared to a method using complete Green's functions, and requires about 0.5 per cent of the computer time. It may be very effective in calculating ground motions in the frequency band 1 to 10 Hz at observers within a few source depths of large earthquakes, where most of the high-frequency motions may be caused by direct P and S waves. We suggest a possible method for inverting ground motions for both slip velocity and rupture velocity over the fault.},

Bayesian statistics provides a framework for parameter estimation in which uncertainties about models and measurements are translated into uncertainties in estimates of parameters. This paper provides a simple, step-by-step example—starting from a physical experiment and going through all of the mathematics—to explain the use of Bayesian techniques for estimating the coeﬃcients of gravity and air friction in the equations describing a falling body. In the experiment we dropped an object from a known height and recorded the free fall using a video camera. The video recording was analyzed frame by frame to obtain the distance the body had fallen as a function of time, including measures of uncertainty in our data that we describe as probability densities. We explain the decisions behind the various choices of probability distributions and relate them to observed phenomena. Our measured data are then combined with a mathematical model of a falling body to obtain probability densities on the space of parameters we seek to estimate. We interpret these results and discuss sources of errors in our estimation procedure.},

Surface elevation observations are being used across an expanding range of ﬁelds to study topographical attributes and their changes over time, notably in glaciology, hydrology, volcanology, seismology, forestry, and geomorphology. However, DEMs frequently contain large-scale instrument noise and varying vertical precision that lead to complex patterns of errors. Here, we present a validated statistical workﬂow to estimate, model, and propagate uncertainties in DEMs. We review the state-of-the-art of DEM accuracy and precision analyses, and deﬁne a conceptual framework to consistently address those. We show how to characterize DEM precision by quantifying the heteroscedasticity of elevation measurements, i.e., varying vertical precision with terrainor sensor-dependent variables, and the spatial correlation of errors that can occur across multiple spatial scales. With the increasing availability of high-precision observations, our workﬂow based on independent elevation data acquired on stable terrain can be applied almost anywhere on Earth. We illustrate how to propagate uncertainties for both pixel-scale and spatial elevation derivatives, using terrain slope and glacier volume changes as examples. We ﬁnd that uncertainties in DEMs are largely underestimated in the literature, and advocate that new metrics of DEM precision are essential to ensure the reliability of future land elevation assessments.},

	doi = {10.1093/comnet/cnz017},
	abstract = {Compared to the heavily studied surface drainage systems, the mountain ridge systems have been a subject of less attention even on the empirical level, despite the fact that their structure is richer. To reduce this deﬁciency, we analyze different mountain ranges by means of a network approach and grasp some essential features of the ridge branching structure. We also employ a fractal analysis as it is especially suitable for describing properties of rough objects and surfaces. As our approach differs from typical analyses that are carried out in geophysics, we believe that it can initialize a research direction that will allow to shed more light on the processes that are responsible for landscape formation and will contribute to the network theory by indicating a need for the construction of new models of the network growth as no existing model can properly describe the ridge formation. We also believe that certain features of our study can offer help in the cartographic generalization. Speciﬁcally, we study structure of the ridge networks based on the empirical elevation data collected by Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. We consider mountain ranges from different geological periods and geographical locations. For each mountain range, we construct a simple “topographic” network representation (i.e., the ridge junctions are nodes) and a “ridge” representation (i.e., the ridges are nodes and the junctions are edges) and calculate the parameters characterizing their topology. We observe that the topographic networks inherit the fractal structure of the mountain ranges but do not show any other complex features. In contrast, the ridge networks, while lacking the proper fractality, reveal the power-law degree distributions with the exponent 1.6 β 1.7. By taking into account the fact that the analyzed mountains differ in many properties, these values seem to be universal for the earthly mountainous terrain.},

	title = {Private sensors and crowdsourced rainfall data: accuracy and effectiveness for monitoring severe events and mapping pluvial flooding in urban areas},
	url = {http://amslaurea.unibo.it/27765/},
	abstract = {The increasing number of extreme rainfall events, combined with the high population density and the imperviousness of the land surface, makes urban areas particularly vulnerable to pluvial flooding. In order to design and manage cities to be able to deal with this issue, the reconstruction of weather phenomena is essential. Among the most interesting data sources which show great potential are the observational networks of private sensors managed by citizens (crowdsourcing). The number of these personal weather stations is consistently increasing, and the spatial distribution roughly follows population density. Precisely for this reason, they perfectly suit this detailed study on the modelling of pluvial flood in urban environments. The uncertainty associated with these measurements of precipitation is still a matter of research. In order to characterise the accuracy and precision of the crowdsourced data, we carried out exploratory data analyses. A comparison between Netatmo hourly precipitation amounts and observations of the same quantity from weather stations managed by national weather services is presented. The crowdsourced stations have very good skills in rain detection but tend to underestimate the reference value. In detail, the accuracy and precision of crowd- sourced data change as precipitation increases, improving the spread going to the extreme values. Then, the ability of this kind of observation to improve the prediction of pluvial flooding is tested. To this aim, the simplified raster-based inundation model incorporated in the Saferplaces web platform is used for simulating pluvial flooding. Different precipitation fields have been produced and tested as input in the model. Two different case studies are analysed over the most densely populated Norwegian city: Oslo. The crowdsourced weather station observations, bias-corrected (i.e. increased by 25\%), showed very good skills in detecting flooded areas.},

	abstract = {Global warming and the associated glacier retreat recently revealed the entrance to an ice–rock tunnel, at an altitude of ∼3600 m a.s.l., in the uppermost portion of the Forni Glacier in the Central Italian Alps. The tunnel served as an entrance to an Austro-Hungarian cableway station excavated in the rocks during the Great War just behind the frontline. A comprehensive geophysical survey, based on seismic and ground-penetrating radar profiling, was then undertaken to map other possible World War I (WWI) remains still embedded in the ice. The ice–rock interface was reconstructed over the entire saddle and in the uppermost portion of the glacier. A prominent linear reflector was surprisingly similar to the common response of buried pipes. The reflector orientation, almost longitudinal to the slope, does not seem to be compatible with a glacial conduit or with other natural features. Numerical simulations of a series of possible targets constrained interpretation to a partly water-filled rounded shape cavity. The presence of a preserved WWI tunnel connecting Mount Vioz and Punta Linke could be considered a realistic hypothesis. The Forni glacier could be still considered polythermal and comprised of cold ice without basal sliding in its top portion.},

Lincei Memorie 7: 299–368, 1938), regarding the metabolic cost of gradient locomotion, together with recent insights on gait biomechanics, a prediction about the most economical gradient of mountain paths (approximately 25\%) is obtained and interpreted. The pendulum-like mechanism of walking produces a waste of mechanical work against gravity within the gradient range of up to 15\% (the overall efficiency is dominated by the low transmission efficiency), whereas for steeper values only the muscular efficiency is responsible for the (slight) metabolic change (per meter of vertical displacement) with respect to gradient. The speeds at the optimum gradient turned out to be approximately 0.65 m/s (+0.16 m/s vertical) and 1.50 m/s (-0.36 m/s vertical), for uphill and downhill walking, respectively, and the ascensional energy expenditure was 0.4 and 2.0 ml O2.kg body mass-1.vertical m-1 climbed or descended. When the metabolic power becomes a burden, as in high-altitude mountaineering, the optimum gradient should be reduced. A sample of real mountain path gradients, experimentally measured, mimics the obtained predictions.},

	abstract = {The performance of one computer relative to another is traditionally characterized through benchmarking, a practice occasionally deﬁcient in statistical rigor. The performance is often trivialized through simpliﬁed measures, such as the approach of central tendency, but doing so risks a loss of perspective of the variability and non-determinism of modern computer systems. Authentic performance evaluations are derived from statistical methods that accurately interpret and assess data. Methods that currently exist within performance comparison frameworks are limited in efﬁcacy, statistical inference is either overtly simpliﬁed or altogether avoided. A prevalent criticism from computer performance literature suggests that the results from difference hypothesis testing lack substance. To address this problem, we propose a new framework, SPARC, that pioneers a synthesis of difference and equivalence hypothesis testing to provide relevant conclusions. It is a union of three key components: (i) identifying either superiority or similarity through difference and equivalence hypotheses (ii) scalable methodology (based on the number of benchmarks), and (iii) a conditional feedback loop from test outcomes that produces informative conclusions of relevance, equivalence, trivial, or indeterminant. We present an experimental analysis characterizing the performance of a trio of RISC-V open-source processors to evaluate SPARC and its efﬁcacy compared to similar frameworks.},

	abstract = {Bright ﬁreballs or bolides are caused by meteoroids entering the Earth’s atmosphere at high speed. Some have a cometary origin, a few may have originated within the Venus-Earth-Mars region as a result of massive impacts in the remote past but a relevant fraction is likely the result of the break-up of asteroids. Disrupted asteroids produce clusters of fragments or asteroid families and meteoroid streams. Linking a bolide to a certain asteroid family may help to understand its origin and pre-impact dynamical evolution. On 2013 February 15, a superbolide was observed in the skies near Chelyabinsk, Russia. Such a meteor could be the result of the decay of an asteroid and here we explore this possibility applying a multistep approach. First, we use available data and Monte Carlo optimization (validated using 2008 TC3 as template) to obtain a robust solution for the pre-impact orbit of the Chelyabinsk impactor (a = 1.62 au, e = 0.53, i = 3◦. 82, Ω = 326◦. 41 and ω = 109◦. 44). Then, we use this most probable orbit and numerical analysis to single out candidates for membership in, what we call, the Chelyabinsk asteroid family. Finally, we perform N -body simulations to either conﬁrm or reject any dynamical connection between candidates and impactor. We ﬁnd reliable statistical evidence on the existence of the Chelyabinsk cluster. It appears to include multiple small asteroids and two relatively large members: 2007 BD7 and 2011 EO40. The most probable parent body for the Chelyabinsk superbolide is 2011 EO40. The orbits of these objects are quite perturbed as they experience close encounters not only with the Earth-Moon system but also with Venus, Mars and Ceres. Under such conditions, the cluster cannot be older than about 20–40 kyr.},

After its entrance to the atmosphere and after travel by several hundred of kilometers the body exploded in a powerful event responsible for physical damages and injured people spread over a region enclosing several large cities. We present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid. Using evidence gathered by one camera at the Revolution Square in the city of Chelyabinsk and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of Korkino, we calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent encounter with our planet. In order to account for the uncertainties implicit in the determination of the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere, we use Monte Carlo methods to calculate the most probable orbital parameters and their dispersion. Although the orbital elements are aﬀected by uncertainties the orbit has been sucesfully reconstructed. We use it to classify the meteoroid among the near Earth asteroid families ﬁnding that the parent body belonged to the Apollo asteroids.},

            Satellite remote sensing provides real-time information on the extent of the snow cover. However, the period of record is generally too short to build a reference climatology from these data alone, preventing their use as climatic indicators. Here we show that reanalysis data can be used to reconstruct a 30 year snow cover time series that fits well with the satellite observations. This climatology can then be used to put the current state of the snow cover into perspective. We implemented this approach to provide real-time information on the snow cover area in the Alps through a web application.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Mi sembra che la spiegazione sia inutilmente complicata, forse perché destinata a chi si occupa di fotogrammetria e non conosce la matematica.
Hogg spiega molto meglio i minimi quadrati (Hogg et al., 2010) in molte meno parole.
Questo è una trattazione minima: “Per due punti passa una sola retta, per tre punti, a meno che non siano allineati, non passano rette… come fare se ho tre punti e voglio una retta? Posso fare i minimi quadrati”, invece (Mikhail, 1976) la fa molto più complicata perché vuole spiegare per primo il caso generale (lodevole, ma secondo me se sei un fotogrammetra che non ne sa di matematica

Some people get back pain just hearing about the Swiss Army's combat backpack. Future generations should suffer less. The Swiss Army is planning to introduce new clothing in 2022. The less popular cold protection jacket (Käschu) is also being replaced. The new clothing and equipment systems are currently being tested in action.
Since July 2017, around 350 members of the army have been testing the new combat clothing, carrying and hydration systems and “ballistic body armor”. They are “tested in daily use for their benefits and added value,” according to a statement from the VBS. “Technological developments and logistical optimization potential” should be taken into account.
After the troop test has been completed, “the knowledge gained is analyzed and assessed and forms the basis for the decision on troop suitability.” By the way: It's not just the clothing that's new, but also the pattern. The new clothing is being tested in plain colors, but when it is introduced it will be given the “multi-field camouflage pattern 16”. At first glance, however, the author cannot see any significant difference to the old camouflage pattern.
This is what the new “multi-field camouflage pattern 16” looks like. (Image: VBS/DDPS)
Anything new with the equipment? Not quite. The army does not want to forego the tried and tested “onion skin principle”. The user should continue to be able to “individually adapt” their clothing to the temperature and weather conditions in the future. Everyone who was in the recruit school must laugh at the word individual.
The new clothing is to be financed with the Armaments Program 19. The initial procurement is expected to cost 250 million francs. Public tenders are carried out before procurement.

The numerical constants a and b are obtained by a linear regression analysis of the logarithmic form of the power law curve (ln y = ln a + b ln x). The value b then gives a measure for the form of the cross-section. However, over the years this form of the power law has endured a lot of criticism. This criticism is well founded, since this particular form of the power law is not suitable for curve ﬁtting in morphological analyses. In this paper a general power law is proposed, of the form y − y0 = ax − x0b (where x0, y0 are the coordinates of the origin of the cross-proﬁle). A unique and unbiased solution for this equation is obtained with a general least-squares method, thereby minimizing the error between the cross-proﬁle data and the curve, and not between the logarithmic transform of the data and its regression line. This provides a robust way to characterize trough cross-section forms. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

              The fact that the cross‐profile of the glacial valley could be well approximated by parabolas (Y = aX
              b
              , b = 2.0) is explained by the variation principle, assuming that the glacier erosion works towards minimizing thefriction between ice and bedrock. The variation principle proves that the ideal or fully‐developed morphology of the glacial valley should be a catenary, the curve which a chain hanging from two fixed points forms. Maclaurin's series expansion of the catenary equation shows that a parabola is a very good approximation of the catenary; hence, the good approximation of the cross‐profile by parabolas.
            
            
              Different catenaries are generated by changing the form ratio (depth/rim width) and are then approximated by Y = aX
              b
              by the method of last‐squares. The b values obtained become only fractionally larger than 2.0 with invreasing form ratios of up to 1.0, indicating that b values would range, in practice, between 1.0 and about 2.0 Two types of trend in the relationship between b values and the form ratio were obtained from several glaciers. For one type the b value becomes larger with increasing form ratios, and for the other the opposite. The first type is called the Rocky Mountain model after its source of data and represents overdeepening of the glacial valley development. The second type is caalled the Patagonia‐Antarctica model, representing a widening, instead of a deepening, process of development. These differences are attributed to the nature of the glaciers which produced these valleys, i.e. alpine glaciers and continental ice sheets.},

The three main approaches to interval estimation (Neyman confidence, Bayesian, likelihood ratio) are discussed and compared in detail, with and without nuisance parameters. Hypothesis testing is discussed mainly from the frequentist point of view, with pointers to the Bayesian literature.

	doi = {10.1098/rspa.1951.0140},
	abstract = {A calculation is made of the distribution of stress and velocity in an ideal glacier and in an ideal ice-sheet. The ice is assumed to have a constant yield stress and to obey, like other polycrystalline plastic aggregates, the Levy-Mises equations of flow and either the Mises or the Tresca criterion of yielding. The solution obtained for an ideal glacier represents the two-dimensional flow of a long slab of ice down a gently undulating rough slope. The addition of ice to the upper surface by snowfall and the removal of ice by ablation are allowed for, but the frictional resistance of the sides of the glacier valley is neglected. Two states of flow are possible, ‘active’ and ‘passive’, corresponding to the active and passive Rankine states in soil mechanics. Which of these states occurs at a given place depends upon the relative magnitudes of the curvature of the bed and the rate of snowfall or ablation; a simple algebraic expression of this dependence is obtained. In both states of flow the velocity is greatest at the surface and decreases with depth according to an elliptical law. It is shown that, in accordance with observation, crevasses of limited depth can open in active flow but not in passive flow. The slip-line field for the problem has a close connexion with the directions and positions of shear faults (although the laminated structure of a glacier is doubtless also an important factor here). In passive flow the faults to be expected are similar to the ‘thrust planes’ often seen on glaciers. The theory suggests that in active flow a complementary sort of shear fault with the opposite direction of movement may occur—and there is some observational evidence for this. The tendency of glaciers to accentuate hollows in their beds is connected with the suggestion that erosion should proceed faster under passive flow than under active flow. The second solution obtained is formally similar but represents the two-dimensional flow of a large ice-sheet, such as the Greenland ice-cap. If a horizontal bed is assumed the profile is calculated to be formed from parts of two parabolas, the maximum height being given by the yield stress of ice. In the accumulation area flow is active. The maximum velocity is every­ where at the surface while the maximum shear rate is on the bed. The solution thus gives no support to the belief that the weight of ice above squeezes out the underlying ice at a faster rate.},

Rather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. In this didactic article, I show that doing this is not trivial once the fractional parallax error is larger than about 20\%, which will be the case for about 80\% of stars in the Gaia catalog. Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available—and is willing to use—concerning, e.g., the survey and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates nonpositive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.},

	abstract = {Recent discussions of model selection and multimodel inference highlight a general challenge for researchers: how to convey the explanatory content of a hypothesized model or set of competing models clearly. The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create “well-formed hypotheses,” as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop wellthought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.},

This type of reporting proves to be most frustrating from the reader's point of view. From the context alone the reader cannot possibly infer whether "e" represents probable error, 3-sigma limits, systematic error, or some combination of random and systematic errors. As a co nsequence, the quality of the results, and the validity of inference drawn from these results, are to a large extent left to the judgment and guesswork of the reader. Hence, the writer owes to himself, and to his reader, to specify clearly the meaning of "e" as he uses it.” (Ku, p. 273)

Topics covered include regression, parameter estimation, model assessment, and Monte Carlo methods, as well as widely used classical methods such as regularization and hypothesis testing. The emphasis throughout is on the principles, the unifying probabilistic approach, and showing how the methods can be implemented in practice. R code (with explanations) is included and is available online, so readers can reproduce the plots and results for themselves.

	abstract = {Il presente lavoro, svolto presso il servizio di Fisica Sanitaria dell?Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria di Parma, consiste nello sviluppo di un metodo innovativo di radioterapia adattativa.
Il metodo � stato applicato a pazienti affetti da varie patologie, trattati con tecnica VMAT, (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy), altamente conformata al target.
Il metodo sviluppato si compone di due fasi: nella prima fase vengono effettuate due analisi su immagini portali, di ricostruzione della dose all'isocentro e l'analisi gamma 2D. Se almeno una di queste fallisce, si interviene con la seconda fase, che vede l'acquisizione della CBCT del paziente e la taratura in densit� elettronica della stessa. Si calcola dunque il piano su CBCT, previa operazione di contouring da parte del medico e, infine, si esegue l'analisi gamma 3D sulle matrici di dose calcolate sulla CT e sulla CBCT del paziente, quantificando gli indici gamma sulle strutture PTV, CTV e OAR di interesse clinico. In base ai risultati, se necessario, si pu� intervenire sul piano di trattamento.
Le analisi gamma 2D e 3D sono state svolte avvalendosi di un software toolkit chiamato GADD-23 (Gamma Analysis on 2D and 3D Dose Distributions) implementato e sviluppato appositamente in ambiente Matlab per questo lavoro di tesi; in particolare, la realizzazione di GADD-23 � stata resa possibile grazie all'interazione con due software di tipo open-source, Elastix e CERR, specifici per l?elaborazione e la registrazione di immagini mediche.
I risultati ottenuti mostrano come il metodo sviluppato sia in grado di mettere in luce cambiamenti anatomici che alcuni pazienti hanno sub�to, di tipo sistematico, in cui � possibile prendere in considerazione una ripianificazione del trattamento per correggerli, o di tipo casuale, sui quali pu� essere utile condurre l'attenzione del medico radioterapista, sebbene non sia necessario un replanning.},

	abstract = {Lo scopo di questo lavoro � la caratterizzazione fisica del flat panel PaxScan4030CB Varian, rivelatore di raggi X impiegato in un ampio spettro di applicazioni cliniche, dalla radiografia generale alla radiologia interventistica.
Nell?ambito clinico, al fine di una diagnosi accurata, � necessario avere una buona qualit� dell?immagine radiologica mantenendo il pi� basso livello di dose rilasciata al paziente.
Elemento fondamentale per ottenere questo risultato � la scelta del rivelatore di radiazione X, che deve garantire prestazioni fisiche (contrasto, risoluzione spaziale e rumore) adeguati alla specifica procedura. Le metriche oggettive che misurano queste caratteristiche sono SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) ed NPS (Noise Power Spectrum), che insieme contribuiscono alla misura della DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency), il parametro pi� completo e adatto a stabilire le performance di un sistema di imaging. L?oggettivit� di queste misure consente anche di mettere a confronto tra loro diversi sistemi di rivelazione.
La misura di questi parametri deve essere effettuata seguendo precisi protocolli di fisica medica, che sono stati applicati al rivelatore PaxScan4030CB presente nel laboratorio del Centro di Coordinamento di Fisica Medica, Policlinico S.Orsola.
I risultati ottenuti, conformi a quelli dichiarati dal costruttore, sono stati confrontati con successo con alcuni lavori presenti in letteratura e costituiscono la base necessaria per la verifica di procedure di ottimizzazione dell?immagine radiologica attraverso interventi sul processo di emissione dei raggi X e sul trattamento informatico dell?immagine (Digital Subtraction Angiography).},

	abstract = {The estimation of the magnitude of extreme winds, and of the risk of their being exceeded, is an essential part of the assessment of wind loads on structures. This paper surveys the various methods available for extreme value analysis which are directly applicable to wind data. These are of two types: those making use of a sampling procedure to derive the parameters of an extreme value distribution, and those which make estimates directly from the total or parent population of wind speeds. The former is a well established technique appropriate to the majority of applications, and will be described in greater detail.
There is some disagreement among wind engineers as to the correct or most useful analytic form for the extreme value distribution of winds. In this paper it is argued that for temperate latitudes, where fully developed weather systems are the dominant cause of strong winds, the extreme value distribution is a Fisher-Tippett (Type I). There is a sound theoretical basis for the use of this distribution. In regions where there is a significant risk of strong winds originating from tropical cyclones and tornadoes a Fisher-Tippett (Type II) distribution may possess certain practical advantages, but a full solution of the problem of wind prediction in these areas should be based upon a different statistical approach, tailored to model these particular wind phenomena. This requires development and an accumulation of suitable meteorological data before it can be fully implemented.
Brief mention is made of methods of estimating extreme winds from the parent population of wind speeds. This has application in cases where there is a very limited length of meteorological records, and also for the analysis of extremes on a directional basis where the more common methods are inapplicable.
The paper is concerned with principles and does not include a detailed mathematical treatment of the topic, which should be south in the references.},

	title = {Human‐induced risk drives behavioural decisions in a recovering brown bear population},
	abstract = {In human-dominated landscapes, rebounding bear populations share space with people, which may lead to bear–human conﬂicts and, consequently, a decrease in acceptance and an increase in bear mortality linked to human causes. Previous analyses of brown bear (Ursus arctos) movement data have shown that bears adopt a security-food trade-off strategy in response to variable human-related risk. However, brown bear ﬂexibility to cope with these risky situations may be reduced when resting, mating or stocking fat in preparation for hibernation. In this study, we measured the multi-scale spatial response of brown bears to human-related risk and food resource distribution in a highly heterogeneous human-dominated landscape. We examined habitat selection both within the population range (‘secondorder’ selection) and at bedding site locations (‘third-order’) for GPS-tagged brown bears of a recently reintroduced population in the Italian Alps. We identiﬁed resting locations by ﬁeld-validated spatio-temporal cluster analysis of telemetry locations. We mapped food availability and distribution using dynamic geographic layers of fruiting wild berries, and human-related risk using human mobility data (Strava-based Cumulated Outdoor activity Index). Brown bears appeared to compromise their need for food resources for avoidance of anthropogenic disturbance when selecting home ranges, as they utilized areas richer in wild berries less when human use of outdoor tracks was higher. Furthermore, selection of resting site locations strongly depended on the avoidance of human-related risk only, with less frequented, more concealed and inaccessible sites being selected. We conclude that humans compete for space with bears beyond their infrastructural impact, that is, by actively occupying key areas for bear survival, thereby potentially restricting the bears’ realized niche. We propose mitigating actions to promote bear–human coexistence by selectively restricting human access to key areas during sensitive annual physiological phases for bear survival.},

	abstract = {La tesi riguarda una analisi di come il concetto di infinitesimo e differenziale sono trattati nei libri di testo di matematica e di fisica a livello universitario. Lo studio si inquadra nel tema pi� generale del ruolo della matematica nell'insegnamento/apprendimento della fisica. La tesi � articolata in quattro capitoli e le conclusioni. Nel primo capitolo si riportano i principali quadri teorici elaborati per riflettere sul ruolo della matematica nell'apprendimento della fisica, e per riconoscere le forme di ragionamento messe in atto da esperti e/o studenti nei processi di modellizzazione matematica o di problem solving. I quadri teorici principali a cui si fa riferimento sono: il quadro di Redish sul processo di modellizzazione, utilizzato anche per indagare i cosiddetti ?epistemic games? messi in atto dagli studenti nella soluzione di problemi, e il modello di Uhden, Karam, Pietrocola e Pospiech. Nel secondo capitolo si ripercorre la storia del concetto di infinitesimo e differenziale a partire dalle concezioni di Newton e Leibniz fino alla nascita dell'analisi non-standard. Le nozioni dell'Analisi verranno formulate e messe a confronto tra Analisi Standard e Non Standard. Nel terzo capitolo si riportano studi di ricerca di didattica della matematica e della fisica sull'apprendimento/insegnamento dei concetti di infinitesimo e differenziale. Le risorse emerse dalla ricerca sul concetto di differenziale e di infinitesimo e sul ruolo della matematica nei processi di insegnamento/apprendimento della fisica, sono state utilizzate nel capitolo 4 per analizzare una selezione di alcuni libri di matematica e di fisica del '900. L'ambito scelto per l'analisi dei libri di fisica � quello della cinematica, in quanto si incontrano per la prima volta i concetti di variazione di spazio e tempo nella velocit� istantanea, ed � possibile individuare differenti tipologie di approccio didattico nel ragionamento che conduce alle equazioni del moto.},

            In a scientific context, a suitable color choice is more than simple decoration. Color handling, as part of scientific visualization, is a scientific methodology that is one of the most widely used, given the importance of figures and images in conveying results. Yet, an expert‐level understanding and application of proper scientific coloring is rare. Here, a concise overview of important color tools is provided and complemented by ready‐to‐apply resources for using color in science research, publishing, communication, tool development, editing, and teaching. This overview offers a guide to spot problems, master the methodology, and support accessible and accurate use of color for science figures in both short and long terms. © 2024 The Author(s).

In order to permit the incorporation of any a priori information about parameters and any distribution of data (not only of gaussian type) we propose to formulate the problem not using single quantities (such as bounds, means, etc.) but using probability density functions for data and parameters. We also want our formulation to allow for the incorporation of theoretical errors, i.e. non-exact theoretical relationships between data and parameters (due to discretization, or incomplete theoretical knowledge); to do that in a natural way we propose to define general theoretical relationships also as probability density functions. We show then that the inverse problem may be formulated as a problem of combination of information: the experimental information about data, the a priori information about parameters, and the theoretical information. With this approach, the general solution of the non-linear inverse problem is unique and consistent (solving the same problem, with the same data, but with a different system of parameters does not change the solution).},

	abstract = {L?elaborato presenta i dati rinvenuti durante il Campo Geologico svolto nell?area di Passo Rolle, nel comune di Primiero San Martino di Castrozza (TN).
L?obiettivo del rilevamento dell?areale di studio � stato la ricostruzione dell?assetto tettono ? stratigrafico della porzione delle Dolomiti orientali, in corrispondenza di Passo Rolle. Grazie al confronto con i gruppi degli adiacenti areali di studio, � stato possibile ricostruire una carta geologica tra Passo Rolle e Passo Valles pi� a Nord. Il riconoscimento delle diverse formazioni e dei diversi membri, nonch� il loro assetto giaciturale, ha permesso un?analisi dettagliata non solo dell?andamento stratigrafico bens� anche dei campi di sforzi ai quali la zona � stata sottoposta. L?areale � infatti stato soggetto ad una tettonica di tipo estensionale durante le varie fasi di rifting associabili all?evoluzione permo-triassica e di tipo compressivo durante l?orogenesi alpina neogenica.
Il rinvenimento di formazioni permiane nella porzione occidentale dell?area di studio (Ignimbriti del Distretto Vulcanico Atesino, Arenarie di Val Gardena e Formazione a Bellerophon) � stato correlato ai membri del Werfen rinvenuti a Est tramite supposizione di una struttura di carattere tettonico. Come verr� illustrato, anche in letteratura si fa riferimento a tale struttura di primaria importanza, la cui nucleazione � presumibilmente avvenuta nel Permiano e ha successivamente subito riattivazioni tettoniche durante il Mesozoico: la Faglia di Passo Rolle. Ulteriori strutture plicative, faglie normali, sovrascorrimenti e faglie inverse sono state rilevate, cartografate e si � proposta una possibile genesi per alcune di esse, tentando dunque di associarle ad una precisa fase della complessa e polifasica orogenesi alpino ? himalayana.},

	abstract = {La seguente relazione geologica presenta le osservazioni ed i dati raccolti durante il lavoro 
di rilevamento svolto nell?area di Passo Valles, un valico alpino situato tra la regione Veneto
e la regione Trentino. In corredo alla relazione vengono allegate una carta geologica della
zona di studio in scala 1:7000 ed una sezione geologica (Allegato 1). L?obiettivo dello studio
� quello di cartografare e comprendere a pieno la geologia dell?area di studio, osservando le
formazioni e le strutture presenti. Inoltre, in aggiunta alle informazioni ottenute, � stato
svolto uno studio sugli isotopi stabili del carbonio organico nelle Filladi di Bressanone,
formazione appartenente al basamento cristallino, osservate all?interno di campioni prelevati
da Cima Tognola.
La sequenza stratigrafica della zona di studio copre un intervallo temporale che va dal
Permiano inferiore (Sakmariano) fino al Triassico medio (Ladinico) ed � disposta con le
formazioni pi� antiche a nord che passano a quelle sempre pi� giovani andando verso sud.
Questa distribuzione stratigrafica ci permette di comprendere al meglio la graduale
evoluzione dovuta al rifting di Pangea che ha portato ad una generale trasgressione marina,
osservabile dalla presenza di successioni pi� antiche e di mare basso che lasciano il posto a
formazioni pi� recenti e di mare profondo.
Sebbene il generale andamento concorde con la stratigrafia, vengono ritrovate alcune
discordanze stratigrafiche dovute all?azione di strutture tettoniche che portano alla creazione
di dislocazioni e rigetti all?interno delle formazioni.
Tutte queste informazioni vengono descritte e analizzate nei successivi paragrafi
dell?elaborato, con l?obiettivo di fornire una chiara spiegazione della storia geologica e degli
eventi che hanno caratterizzato la zona di Passo Valles.},

	abstract = {The Port Askaig Formation is a succession of Cryogenian glacial deposits found near the middle of the 25 km thick Dalradian Supergroup. On the Isle of Islay, Scotland, the Port Askaig Formation is approximately 750 mthick in the north and thins over approximately 30 km to a few tens of meters towards the southern end ofthe island. The thinning of this stratum was investigated by performing a literary review of previous works to construct six stratigraphic columns and three cross-sections across the eastern half of Islay. Two models were developed using these cross-sections and columns to explain the thinning of the Port Askaig Formation on Islay. The syndepositional model suggests that the Dalradian sediments were deposited during the late Neoproterozoic Era in an extensional basin over an array of listric normal faults with increasing tectonic activity resulting in lateral thickness changes over short distances. The synorogenic model suggeststhe Dalradian Basin was subjected to deformation in the Caledonian Orogeny during the Ordovician Period. The basin experienced both extensional and compressional stresses resulting in thickness changes throughfolding, faulting, and shearing of the Dalradian sediments. It can be concluded that the major control of thinning of the Port Askaig Formation is due to basin tectonics, followed by the folding of the Dalradian Basin by compressive stresses.},

It covers the mineralogy, chemistry, textures, and sedimentary structures that characterise sedimentary rocks, and relates these features to the depositional origin of the rocks and their subsequent alteration by diagenetic processes during burial. In addition to detailed sections on siliciclastic and carbonate rocks, it also discusses evaporites, cherts, iron-rich sedimentary rocks, phosphorites, and carbonaceous sedimentary rocks such as oil shales. This second edition maintains the comprehensive treatment of sedimentary petrography and petrology provided in the first edition, and has been updated with new concepts and cutting-edge techniques like cathodoluminescence imaging of sedimentary rocks and backscattered electron microscopy. It is ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in sedimentary petrology, and is a key reference for researchers and professional petroleum geoscientists.},

              O records from 57 globally distributed sites aligned by an automated graphic correlation algorithm. This is the first benthic δ
              18
              O stack composed of more than three records to extend beyond 850 ka, and we use its improved signal quality to identify 24 new marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene. We also present a new LR04 age model for the Pliocene‐Pleistocene derived from tuning the δ
              18
              O stack to a simple ice model based on 21 June insolation at 65°N. Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model constraints to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning strategy, the LR04 benthic stack exhibits significant coherency with insolation in the obliquity band throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in the precession band for more than half of the record. The LR04 stack contains significantly more variance in benthic δ
              18
              O than previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result of higher‐resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater percentage of records from the Atlantic. Finally, the relative phases of the stack's 41‐ and 23‐kyr components suggest that the precession component of δ
              18
              O from 2.7–1.6 Ma is primarily a deep‐water temperature signal and that the phase of δ

However, many students believe that the buoyant force is determined by the object’s attributes, such as the shape (e.g., ship) or material (e.g., wood). As a result, students find it challenging to understand that buoyant force changes when different volumes of the same object are submerged in water, or when the same object is submerged in different fluids. In response to the question concerning whether the weight of a cup changes when a tea bag is placed in a cup of water, 63.3\% of first-year university students who majored in physics or chemistry were wrong. The problems related to buoyant force are difficult to understand even for college students, so the topic is used in the selection process for gifted students. Although numerous educational attempts have been made to help students understand the concept, buoyant force is still a difficult concept for them. Thus, an easy and clear approach to help students understand the buoyant force is desirable.},

Il suo eventuale scioglimento porterebbe a una diminuzione del volume d'acqua spostato a cui, però, si aggiungerebbe l'acqua del ghiaccio fuso, per cui il livello dell'acqua dei mari non subirebbe nel complesso variazioni, come accade per un cubetto di ghiaccio in un bicchiere d'acqua.

	abstract = {The ALICE experiment at CERN has planned an upgrade of the Inner Tracking System (ITS), named ITS3, for the LHC Long Shutdown 3, in 2025. The cornerstone of the upgrade is a new CMOS pixel sensor built in 65 nm technology and in bent-cylindrical configuration, replacing the inner layers of the existing detector, the ITS2. The ITS3 will reach much better tracking and vertexing performance, thanks to the improved spatial resolution and the much reduced material budget with respect to the previous Inner Tracking System. 
The aim of this thesis is to report on the analysis of the data collected at beam tests on new ALPIDE chips (used for ITS2, based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor, MAPS) which have been bent in a cylindrical configuration as foreseen for the ITS3. This is the first bending proof of concept for a silicon detector.
In particular, data from beam test taken in 2020 have been studied through a data analysis framework that I have personally written to accomplish this task; the complexity of the data analysis is driven by the fact that each ALPIDE chip has a total of 1024x512 pixel MAPS and by the bent geometry of the sensor.
In this thesis, the promising performances obtained by studying the sensor total efficiency and spatial resolution in different experimental configurations will be presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Negli ultimi anni diversi report europei hanno messo in evidenza come in Europa ci sia bisogno di attrarre pi� giovani allo studio delle discipline scientifiche (STEM ? Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Il problema dell'abbandono degli studi universitari scientifici da parte degli studenti rappresenta un elemento problematico soprattutto in Europa ma anche in Italia.
Lo studio descritto in questa tesi si colloca in attivit� del Piano Lauree Scientifiche del Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia di Bologna, realizzate come continuazione del progetto europeo HOPE - Horizons in Physics Education.
Obiettivo delle attivit� � continuare a monitorare i fattori che spingono gli studenti ad iscriversi a fisica e i motivi di insoddisfazione che possono portare all?abbandono. L?indagine � stata condotta somministrando un questionario a studenti del primo, del secondo e del terzo anno, e realizzando alcune interviste e l?analisi dei dati raccolti.
Oggetto specifico del lavoro qui descritto � stata l?analisi dei dati raccolti e un loro confronto coi risultati di HOPE.
L?indagine condotta conferma quanto � emerso nel progetto HOPE sia per l?indagine sui fattori di interesse, sia per i profili di insoddisfazione.
In particolare � evidente che i principali motivi di interesse sono rappresentati da fattori interni, quali interesse e la curiosit� verso il mondo naturale e l?interesse per l?approccio e i metodi della scienza. Alcuni studenti evidenziano anche una attenzione per la ricaduta sociale della fisica e le sue applicazioni.
Per quanto riguarda i motivi di insoddisfazione emerge che le principali difficolt� sono dovute alla gestione dei ritmi universitari e alla difficolt� di alcuni contenuti trattati. Le difficolt� sono solitamente percepite come personali e gli studenti, pur interessati alla fisica, non sempre si sentono all?altezza di comprenderla fino in fondo.},

However, user interactions based on spatial codes (e.g., displaying codes on phone screens for exchanging contact information) are often tedious, time consuming, and prone to errors due to image corruptions such as noise, blur, saturation, and perspective distortions. We propose Light Codes (LICO), a novel method for fast and fluid exchange of information among users. Light codes are based on transmitting and receiving temporal codes (instead of spatial) using compact and low-cost transceiver devices. The resulting approach enables seamless and near instantaneous exchange of short messages among users with minimal physical and cognitive effort. We design novel coding techniques, hardware prototypes, and applications that are optimized for human-centric communication, and facilitate fast and fluid user-to-user interactions in various challenging conditions, including a range of distances, motion, and ambient illumination. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods both via quantitative analysis and user study based comparisons with several existing approaches including display-camera links, Bluetooth, and near-field communication, which show strong preference toward Light Codes in various real-world application scenarios.},

Our molds, PackMolds, feature neither undercuts nor negative draft angles, facilitating their easy release from thermoformed plastic sheets. In this study, we optimize the geometry of PackMolds to comply with user-speciﬁed draft angle constraints. Instead of simulating the traditional thermoforming process, which necessitates time discretization and specifying detailed parameters for both material properties and machine conﬁguration to achieve an accurate simulation result, we formulate our problem as a constrained geometric optimization problem and solve it using a gradient-based solver. Additionally, in contrast to industrial thermoforming, which beneﬁts from advanced tools, desktop thermoforming lacks such sophisticated resources. Therefore, we introduce a suite of assistive tools to enhance the success of desktop thermoforming. Furthermore, we demonstrate its wide applicability by showcasing its use in not only designing blister packs but also in creating double-sided blister packs and model stands.},

Our method reproduces a seamless transition of terrain textures according to the seasons by learning measured data on the earth using a convolutional neural network. We attribute the main seasonal texture transition to vegetation and snow, and control the texture synthesis not only with the input heightﬁeld but also with the annual temperature and precipitation based on Köppen’s climate classiﬁcation as well as insolation at the location. We found that month-by-month synthesis yields incoherent transitions, while a naïve conditioning with explicit temporal information (e.g., month) degrades generalizability due to the north–south hemisphere difference. To address these issues, we introduce a simple solution—periodic conditioning on the annual data without explicit temporal information. Our experiments reveal that our method can synthesize plausible seasonal transitions of terrain textures. We also demonstrate large-scale texture synthesis by tiling the texture output.},

This unique property makes opal a highly valuable material from the natural science, industry, and humanity perspectives. Opal has a complex internal structure called colloidal polycrystalline, and thus, representations of opal remain unestablished in computer graphics. In this study, to approximate the complex internal structure of opal, we imitate its formation process using the three-dimensional additively weighted Voronoi tessellation and percolation model. Further, we apply path tracing to compute the diffraction patterns of visible light inside opal by utilizing the Ewald construction employed in X-ray diffraction theory. Finally, we achieve a visually plausible output through spectral rendering.},

Our approach breaks down erosion into two key processes—terrain alteration and material transport—allowing for ﬂexibility in simulation. We utilize independent particles governed by basic particle physics principles, enabling efﬁcient parallel computation. For increased precision, a vector ﬁeld can adjust particle speed, adaptable for realistic ﬂuid simulations or user-deﬁned control. We address material alteration in 3D terrains with a set of equations applicable across diverse models, requiring only per-particle speciﬁcations for size, density, coefﬁcient of restitution, and sediment capacity. Our modular algorithm is versatile for real-time and ofﬂine use, suitable for both 2.5D and 3D terrains.},

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray muon radiography has the potential to reveal the density structure of gigantic objects. It utilizes the strong penetration ability of high-energy muons. By measuring the number of muons that travel through a target object, the average density can be calculated along the muon path. Since muons travel in straight paths through matter, specially designed detectors can generate density maps with higher spatial resolution than those obtained with conventional geophysical methods. However, this technique has a few notable limitations in that it can only be applied to near-surface structures above the muon sensor and strongly depends on the characteristics of the local topography. This is due to the fact that almost all cosmic-ray muons arrive only from the upper hemisphere. Geological structures, e.g. volcanoes, that allow for muon detectors to be placed on a slope directly below the point of interest are thus the best candidates for this technique. The drawback of muon radiography that only the horizontally integrated density above the sensor is measured with a time resolution larger than several weeks may be partly remedied by combining its results with gravity data, as they are both sensitive to target density while complementary to each other in several aspects. An example of such a combination is presented: real-time monitoring of magma head height in a volcano conduit.},
