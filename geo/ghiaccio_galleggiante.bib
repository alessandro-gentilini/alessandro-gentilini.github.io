	abstract = {In this guide, we present a reading list to serve as a concise introduction to Bayesian data analysis. The introduction is geared toward reviewers, editors, and interested researchers who are new to Bayesian statistics. We provide commentary for eight recommended sources, which together cover the theoretical and practical cornerstones of Bayesian statistics in psychology and related sciences. The resources are presented in an incremental order, starting with theoretical foundations and moving on to applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment. After consulting our guide, the reader should understand how and why Bayesian methods work, and feel able to evaluate their use in the behavioral and social sciences.},

	abstract = {The NW Iberian margin is a hyperextended continental margin, formed during the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean, where a subsequent partial tectonic inversion has undergone during the Alpine Orogeny. This succession of tectonic episodes determines the magnetic signature of the margin. The Spanish Exclusive Economic Zone Project has carried out seven one-month cruises between 2001 and 2009. To extend and densify the spatial coverage, we have used data from the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map. Here, we describe the methodology used for the acquisition and data processing of the magnetic ﬁeld data. The use of diverse instrumentation, a non-complete external ﬁeld’s cancelation, and the use of diﬀerent magnetic core ﬁeld models, contributed to the total error budget. To reduce it, we have used a leveling algorithm which minimizes all these contributions. Finally, a statistical analysis was applied using crossover residuals, showing a resolution better than 28 nT.},

	abstract = {Digital algorithms for robust detection of phase arrivals in the presence of stationary and nonstationary noise have a long history in seismology and have been exploited primarily to reduce the amount of data recorded by data logging systems to manageable levels. In the present era of inexpensive digital storage, however, such algorithms are increasingly being used to flag signal segments in continuously recorded digital data streams for subsequent processing by automatic and/or expert interpretation systems. In the course of our development of an automated, near-real-time, waveform correlation event-detection and location system (WCEDS), we have surveyed the abilities of such algorithms to enhance seismic phase arrivals in teleseismic data streams. Specifically, we have considered envelopes generated by energy transient (STA/LTA), Z-statistic, frequency transient, and polarization algorithms. The WCEDS system requires a set of input data streams that have a smooth, low-amplitude response to background noise and seismic coda and that contain peaks at times corresponding to phase arrivals. The algorithm used to generate these input streams from raw seismograms must perform well under a wide range of source, path, receiver, and noise scenarios. Present computational capabilities allow the application of considerably more robust algorithms than have been historically used in real time. However, highly complex calculations can still be computationally prohibitive for current workstations when the number of data streams become large. While no algorithm was clearly optimal under all source, receiver, path, and noise conditions tested, an STA/LTA algorithm incorporating adaptive window lengths controlled by nonstationary seismogram spectral characteristics was found to provide an output that best met the requirements of a global correlation-based event-detection and location system.},

	abstract = {The goal of geophysicalinversionis to make quantitative inferences about the Earth from remote observations. Because the observations are finite in number and subject to uncertainty, these inferencesare inherently probabilistic. A key step is to define what it means for an Earth model to fit the data. This requires estimation of the uncertaintiesin the data, both thosedue to random noise and thosedue to theoreticalerrors. But the set of modelsthat fit the data usually containsunrealisticmodels;i.e., modelsthat violate our a priori prejudices,other data, or theoreticalconsiderations.One strategyfor eliminatingsuchunreasonable modelsis to definean a priori probability density on the spaceof models,then use Bayestheoremto combinethis probability with the data misfit function into a final a posterioriprobability densityreflectingboth data fit and model reasonableness. We showhere a casestudy of the applicationof the Bayesianstrategyto inversion of surfaceseismicfield data. Assumingthat all uncertaintiescan be describedby multidimensionalGaussianprobability densities,we incorporateinto the calculation information about ambient noise,discretizationerrors, theoreticalerrors, and a priori information about the set of layered Earth modelsderived from in situ petrophysical measurements.The result is a probability density on the spaceof modelsthat takes into accountall of this information. Inferenceson modelparameterscanbe derivedby integrationof this function. We begin by estimatingthe parametersof the Gaussian probability densitiesassumedto describethe data and model uncertainties. These are combinedvia Bayes theorem. The a posteriori probability is then optimized via a nonlinear conjugategradient procedureto find the maximum a posteriori model. Uncertainty analysisis performedby making a Gaussianapproximationof the a posteriori distribution about this peak model. We presentthe resultsof this analysis in three different forms: the maximum a posteriori model bracketedby one standard deviation error bars, pseudo-randomsimulationsof the a posteriori probability (showingthe rangeof typicalsubsurfacme odels),andmarginalsof this probability at selecteddepths in the subsurface. The models we compute are consistentboth with the surfaceseismicdata and the boreholemeasurementse, venthoughthe latter are well below the resolutionof the former. We alsocontrast the Bayesianmaximum a posteriorimodel with the Occammodel, which is the smoothestmodel that fits the surface seismic data alone.},

	abstract = {Background: Density estimation is a key issue in wildlife management but is particularly challenging and labourintensive for elusive species. Recently developed approaches based on remotely collected data and capture-recapture models, though representing a valid alternative to more traditional methods, have found little application to species with limited morphological variation. We implemented a camera trap capture-recapture study to survey wolf packs in a 560-km2 area of Central Italy. Individual recognition of focal animals (alpha) in the packs was possible by relying on morphological and behavioural traits and was validated by non-invasive genotyping and inter-observer agreement tests. Two types (Bayesian and likelihood-based) of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) models were fitted on wolf pack capture histories, thus obtaining an estimation of pack density in the area.
Results: In two sessions of camera trapping surveys (2014 and 2015), we detected a maximum of 12 wolf packs. A Bayesian model implementing a half-normal detection function without a trap-specific response provided the most robust result, corresponding to a density of 1.21 ± 0.27 packs/100 km2 in 2015. Average pack size varied from 3.40 (summer 2014, excluding pups and lone-transient wolves) to 4.17 (late winter-spring 2015, excluding lone-transient wolves).
Conclusions: We applied for the first time a camera-based SCR approach in wolves, providing the first robust estimate of wolf pack density for an area of Italy. We showed that this method is applicable to wolves under the following conditions: i) the existence of sufficient phenotypic/behavioural variation and the recognition of focal individuals (i.e. alpha, verified by non-invasive genotyping); ii) the investigated area is sufficiently large to include a minimum number of packs (ideally 10); iii) a pilot study is carried out to pursue an adequate sampling design and to train operators on individual wolf recognition. We believe that replicating this approach in other areas can allow for an assessment of density variation across the wolf range and would provide a reliable reference parameter for ecological studies.},

	abstract = {A natural, well-preserved mummy belonging to a 35-40 years old male was found in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Popoli, Abruzzo region, central Italy. His fine clothes and burial location suggested that he was of high social status and had an important role in the church community. Most likely, he was a nobleman and a member of the Holy Trinity congregation. Two artifacts, a medallion and a relic of Saint Philomena, helped to date back the individual’s time of death to the early 1800’s. To conduct scientific analyses the body was secured to a cardboard layer by a plastic film and submitted to external examination, digital radiology, and computed tomography scanning, as well as histologic examination of samples obtained by video endoscopy. Anthropological investigations allowed us to observe pathological conditions as poor dental health, pulmonary pathology and a left renal stone. The renal stone was endoscopically removed and submitted to binocular stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy also with microanalysis and X-ray diffraction analysis. The ovoid mass measured 22x16x15 mm, showing surface spherical buds and a nucleus of sharpedged crystals with concentric laminations. Chemical elements were C, O, N, Ca, P, K, S, Cl, Na, arranged in calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite) (90\%) and calcium phosphate (hydroxylapatite) (10\%). The stone composition indicates a high animal protein intake by the subject, confirming that he belonged to high social class. The co-existence of caries, without major arthritic changes indicates that this man lived a life free from extensive labour. In fact, his death appears to be related to infectious complications of renal urolithiasis.},

On the other hand, in this paper a number of additional aspects have been put in evidence providing detailed aspects on mobility and parking that allowed us to better analyze the impact of the reopening on an eventual revamping of the infection. To this end, the collected data from the field have been compared from those of google and some considerations with respect to the Imperial college Report 20 have been derived. For the pollutant aspects, a relevant reduction on most of them has been measured and rationales are reported.},

We have qualitatively assessed the selected volcano–tectonic geosites by applying a set of criteria derived from previous studies and illustrated them through ﬁeld photographs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured images and 3-D models. Finally, we have discussed and compared the diﬀerent options and advantages provided by such visualization techniques and proposed a novel, cutting-edge approach to geoheritage promotion and popularization, based on interactive, navigable Virtual Outcrops made available online.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in ﬁtting a model to data, using as an example the ﬁt of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares ﬁtting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being ﬁt. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent ﬁtting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are “nuisance parameters” to marginalize away.},

We propose a new approach that is solely based on plane homographies, calculated from point correspondences, and that does not require the recovery of the 3D structure of the scene. Neither vanishing points nor lines need to be extracted from the images. The case of a moving camera with constant intrinsic parameters and the one of cameras with possibly different parameters are both addressed. Extensive experiments with both synthetic and real images have validated our approach.},

The Python framework is used for computation and visualization and integrates the common programs for earthquake data processing, such as GAD.exe, JHD.exe, and HypoDD.exe. It is also integrates the common procedure of routine data processing in earthquake seismology and works in local and regional scale. In this paper, we shows the preliminary results of LINDU software for several functions. To identify arrival time of P-wave we employ Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), MER (Modified Energy Ratio) and S/L Kurt’s method. The results of these method will be considered as guided – auto picking. However, the results also can be treated as reference for picking manually with Seisgram2k.jar. Geiger’s method is employed to locate the event location. The events can be relocated and 1D velocity can be updated by employing Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD). The next method to relocate the event location is Double Difference (DD) algorithm. The precision result of Lindu software has been tested using IRIS and real data available which run seamlessly.},

However, in quantitative seismology, achieving accurate, bias-free earthquake locations still remains to be the one of most important and challenging tasks. In this article, we give an overview on various earthquake location methods, that vary from linearized to nonlinear, from grid search to probabilistic algorithms. We review single and multipleevent location techniques, along with computational complexities of each algorithm. An example from a real-world earthquake location problem is given to highlight the importance of data availability in achieving bias-free earthquake locations. We discuss earthquake location accuracy, and uncertainty estimation that originate from measurement and modelling errors. We end with a list that summarizes publicly available earthquake location software packages. We conclude with an outlook for future directions towards data driven machine learning techniques in earthquake location research.},

	abstract = {Horses have a tendency to utilize a relatively narrow set of speeds near the middle of a much broader range they are capable of using within a particular gait, i.e., a preferred speed. Possible explanations for this behavior include minimizing musculoskeletal stresses and maximizing metabolic economy. If metabolic economy (cost of transport, C
              T
              ) and preferred speeds are linked, then shifts in C
              T
              should produce shifts in preferred speed. To test this hypothesis, preferred speed was measured in trotting horses ( n = 7) unloaded on the level and loaded with 19\% of their body weight on the level. The preferred speed on the level was 3.33 ± 0.09 (SE) m/s, and this decreased to 3.13 ± 0.11 m/s when loaded. In both conditions (no load and load), the rate of O
              2
              consumption ( n = 3) was a curvilinear function of speed that produced a minimum C
              T
              (i.e., speed at which trotting is most economical). When unloaded, the speed at which C
              T
              was minimum was very near the preferred speed. With a load, C
              T
              decreased and the minimum was also near the preferred speed of horses while carrying a load.},

The displacement required to produce melting depends on the magnitude of the regional stress and also on the friction stress. If both stresses are one kilobar melting can occur for displacements as small as one millimetre. If, however, both stresses are ten bars melting is impossible for any observed displacement. It is estimated that the width of the melted zone could be between 2 mm and lcm. Melting on fault planes during earthquakes is not in disagreementwith geological and geophysical observations, and suggests a new explanation for some mylonites. Melting may be important because the molten film rock formed on the fault may act as a lubricant and in the case of large earthquakes allow the release of almost all the elastic strain in the region of the shock. This would provide an important constraint in estimating the state of stress along a fault.},

The wealth of publicly-available seismic data nowadays requires automated, fast, and reliable tools to carry out a multitude of tasks, such as the detection of small, local earthquakes in areas characterized by sparsity of receivers. A similar application of machine learning, however, should be built on a large amount of labeled seismograms, which is neither immediate to obtain nor to compile. In this study we present a large dataset of seismograms recorded along the vertical, north, and east components of 1487 broad-band or very broad-band receivers distributed worldwide; this includes 629,095 3component seismograms generated by 304,878 local earthquakes and labeled as EQ, and 615,847 ones labeled as noise (AN). Application of machine learning to this dataset shows that a simple Convolutional Neural Network of 67,939 parameters allows discriminating between earthquakes and noise single-station recordings, even if applied in regions not represented in the training set. Achieving an accuracy of 96.7, 95.3, and 93.2\% on training, validation, and test set, respectively, we prove that the large variety of geological and tectonic settings covered by our data supports the generalization capabilities of the algorithm, and makes it applicable to real-time detection of local events. We make the database publicly available, intending to provide the seismological and broader scientiﬁc community with a benchmark for time-series to be used as a testing ground in signal processing.},

The microstructural record of fault rocks active at the brittle–ductile transition zone (BDTZ) may retain information on the rheological parameters driving the switch in deformation mode and on the role of stress and fluid pressure in controlling different fault slip behaviours. In this study we analysed the deformation microstructures of the strike-slip fault zone BFZ045 in Olkiluoto (SW Finland), located in the site of a deep geological repository for nuclear waste. We combined microstructural analysis, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and mineral chemistry data to reconstruct the variations in pressure, temperature, fluid pressure, and differential stress that mediated deformation and strain localization along BFZ045 across the BDTZ. BFZ045 exhibits a mixed ductile–brittle deformation, with a narrow ({\textless}20 cm thick) brittle fault core with cataclasites and pseudotachylytes that overprint a wider (60–100 cm thick) quartz-rich mylonite. Mylonitic deformation took place at 400–500 ∘C and 3–4 kbar, typical of the greenschist facies metamorphism at the base of the seismogenic crust. We used the recrystallized grain size piezometry for quartz to document a progressive increase in differential stress, from ca. 50 to ca. 120 MPa, towards the shear zone centre during mylonitization and strain localization. Syn-kinematic quartz veins formed along the mylonitic foliation due to transiently high pore fluid pressure (up to lithostatic value). The overprint of the veins by dynamic recrystallization and mylonitic creep is further evidence of the occurrence of brittle events under overall ductile conditions. We propose a conceptual model in which the ductile–brittle deformation cycle was controlled by transient oscillations in fluid pressure and progressively higher differential stress, possibly occurring in a narrowing shear zone deforming towards the peak strength of the crust at the BDTZ.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The dynamic evolution of fault zones at the seismogenic
brittle–ductile transition zone (BDTZ) expresses the delicate interplay
between numerous physical and chemical processes. Deformation and fluid flow
at the BDTZ are closely related and mutually dependent during repeating and
transient cycles of frictional and viscous deformation. Despite numerous
studies documenting in detail seismogenic faults exhumed from the BDTZ,
uncertainties remain as to the exact role of fluids in facilitating broadly
coeval brittle and ductile deformation at that structural level. We combine
structural analysis, fluid inclusion, and mineral chemistry data from
synkinematic and authigenic minerals to reconstruct the temporal variations
in fluid pressure (Pf), temperature (T), and bulk composition (X) of
the fluids that mediated deformation and steered strain localization along
BFZ300, a strike–slip fault originally active at the BDTZ. BFZ300 deforms
the Paleoproterozoic migmatitic basement of southwestern Finland and hosts
in its core two laterally continuous quartz veins formed by two texturally
distinct types of quartz – Qtz I and Qtz II, with Qtz I older than Qtz II.
Veins within the damage zone are formed exclusively by Qtz I. Mesostructural and
microstructural analysis combined with fluid compositional data indicate
recurrent cycles of mutually overprinting brittle and ductile deformation
triggered by oscillations of fluid pressure peaking at 210 MPa. Fluid
inclusion microthermometry and mineral pair geothermometry indicate that the
two documented quartz types precipitated from different fluid batches, with
bulk salinities in the 1 wt \% NaCleq–5 wt \% NaCleq range for Qtz I and in the 6 wt \% NaCleq–11 wt \% NaCleq range for Qtz II.
The temperature of the fluids involved with
initial strain localization and later fault reactivation evolved through
time from {\textgreater} 350 ∘C during Qtz I precipitation to
{\textless} 300 ∘C at the time of Qtz II crystallization. The peak
fluid pressure estimates constrain pore pressure oscillations between 80 and
210 MPa during the recorded faulting episodes. Our results suggest
variability of the physico-chemical conditions of the fluids steering
deformation (Pf, T, X), reflecting the ingress and effects of
multiple batches of fluid in the fault zone. Initial fluid-mediated
embrittlement generated a diffuse network of joints and/or hybrid–shear
fractures in the damage zone; subsequent strain localization led to more
localized deformation within the fault core. Localization was guided by
cyclically increasing fluid pressure and transient embrittlement of a system
that was otherwise under overall ductile conditions. Our analysis suggests that fluid overpressure at the BDTZ can play a key
role in the initial embrittlement of the deforming rock and steer subsequent
strain localization.},

Allometry, the statistical relationship between size and shape, is estimated in geometric morphometrics by regression of the Procrustes shape coordinates on centroid size.

	abstract = {It has been suggested that plume arrival at the base of the lithosphere introduces a push force that overwhelms the balance of torques driving plate circuits, leading to plate-tectonic reorganizations. Among the most compelling evidence in support of a “plume-push” mechanism is the apparent coincidence between eruption of the Deccan flood basalts around 67–64 Ma and a short-lived increase in Indian (and decrease in African) plate speed. Using existing and newly calculated high-resolution plate-motion models, we show that plate divergence rates briefly increased throughout the Indo-Atlantic circuit, contrary to the expected effects of plume-push. We propose that this circuit-wide spike in divergence rates is best explained as the artifact of a magnetic reversal time-scale error around the much studied CretaceousTertiary boundary, and that the period spanning chrons C29–C28 lasted 70\% longer than currently assumed. Corrected for this error, the residual long-term patterns of Indo-Atlantic plate motions and accompanying plate-tectonic reorganization are explicable in terms of maturation of the circuit’s spreading ridges, without invoking a significant plume-push force.},

The functions 0F1, 1F1, 2F1 and 2F0 (or the Kummer U -function) are supported for unrestricted complex parameters and argument, and by extension, we cover exponential and trigonometric integrals, error functions, Fresnel integrals, incomplete gamma and beta functions, Bessel functions, Airy functions, Legendre functions, Jacobi polynomials, complete elliptic integrals, and other special functions. The output can be used directly for interval computations or to generate provably correct ﬂoating-point approximations in any format. Performance is competitive with earlier arbitrary-precision software, and sometimes orders of magnitude faster. We also partially cover the generalized hypergeometric function pFq and computation of high-order parameter derivatives.},

An investigation of those areas more susceptible to rockfall represents a key approach to improve the analysis and management of rockfall impact and consequences. The proposed procedure involves the study of occurred rockfall databases and thematic maps to compute a susceptibility map, by the employment of Analytical Hierarchic Process. The computation is focused on the road network of Aosta Valley Region (northwestern Italy) and its proximity. The model results highlight the importance of morphometric factors on the investigated phenomena. The outcomes of the analysis were also validated by comparing rockfall databases with the receiver operating characteristic curve, in order to conﬁrm their reliability. The results of the procedure are a starting point for a detailed planning action in order to manage the hazard related to these phenomena.},

            Many volcanic systems around the world are located beneath, or in close proximity to, ice caps. Mass change of these ice caps causes surface movements, which are typically neglected when interpreting surface deformation measurements around these volcanoes. These movements can however be significant and may closely resemble movements due to magma accumulation. Here we show such an example, from Katla volcano, Iceland. Horizontal movements observed by GPS on the flank of Katla have led to the inference of significant inflow of magma into a chamber beneath the caldera, starting in 2000 and continuing over several years. We use satellite radar interferometry and GPS data to show that between 2001 and 2010, the horizontal movements seen on the flank can be explained by the response to the long term shrinking of ice caps and that erratic movements seen at stations within the caldera are also not likely to signify magma inflow. It is important that interpretations of geodetic measurements at volcanoes in glaciated areas consider the effect of ice mass change and previous studies should be carefully reevaluated.},

              The magmatic history of the Oldest Toba Tuff (OTT), the second largest in volume after the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT), northern Sumatra, Indonesia, was investigated using U–Pb zircon dating by LA-ICP-MS. Zircon dates obtained from surface and interior sections yielded ages of 0.84 ± 0.03 Ma and 0.97 ± 0.03 Ma, respectively. The youngest OTT zircon ages were in accordance with the
              40
              Ar/
              39
              Ar eruption age of {\textasciitilde} 0.8 Ma, whereas the oldest zircon dates were {\textasciitilde} 1.20 Ma. Therefore, the distribution of zircon U–Pb ages is interpreted to reflect protracted zircon crystallization, suggesting that the estimated 800–2,300 km
              3
              of OTT magma accumulated and evolved for at least 400,000 years prior to eruption. This result is comparable to the volume and timescales of YTT magmatism. The similarities of both magmatic duration and geochemistry between OTT and YTT may indicate that they are similar in size and that the caldera collapse that generated OTT might be much larger previously interpreted.},

	abstract = {Objectives Persons with spinal cord injury live with neurogenic bowel dysfunction. Difﬁculties with management of neurogenic bowel can increase over time with age and time post injury, with a negative impact on autonomy and quality of life. Many conservative treatments are available to improve bowel management; however, in case of failure, a colostomy may be considered. Setting Specialized Care Unit, Montecatone Rehabilitation Institute and General Surgery Division, Imola Hospital, Imola, Italy.
Methods From 2016 to 2019, selected patients affected by SCI and bowel dysfunction failing conservative care were treated with subtotal colectomy associated with placement of a bioabsorbable prosthesis, to prevent parastomal hernia. The surgical procedure is presented along with results.
Results Overall, 19 individuals underwent the described procedure; after 1 year of follow-up, we observed four minor complications: two cases of dehiscence of the abdominal incision, easily treated during hospital stay, and two cases of leakage of mucorrhoea.
Conclusion Our results demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the procedure to improve bowel management in persons with spinal cord injury. Introduction Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) often present neurogenic bowel dysfunction [1, 2]. The most reported difﬁculties are represented by constipation, abdominal pain, incontinence, taking a long time for bowel care, and susceptibility to autonomic dysreﬂexia. Difﬁculties increase over time with age and duration of the SCI. Bowel problems largely affect quality of life and represent “a major physical and psychological problem in SCI” [3–5]. Individuals with neurogenic bowel disease suffer not only because of the symptoms related to SCI, but also because of the social isolation caused by the fear of intestinal accidents. This},

Therefore, severe droughts of extended duration could have led to large variations in the frequency and intensity of geyser eruptions. To characterize potential changes in eruption activity of the iconic Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park over past centuries, we collected mineralized wood samples from its mound and used radiocarbon to date when these trees grew. Because trees do not live on active geyser mounds, we infer that the trees grew during a protracted period without eruptions. The dated fossil trees are from the 13th and 14th Centuries during a time with severe multidecadal droughts in the region. Because climate models forecast increasingly severe droughts by mid21st century, geyser eruptions could become less frequent or completely cease.},

	abstract = {Stress orientations are determined for the Friuli area from focal mechanisms using the inversion technique of Gephart and Forsyth (1984). The data consist of 244 fault plane solutions selected for the period 1988—1995. Where the data coverage was poor, this period was extended to 1978—1996. Local magnitude ranges from 2.0 to 4.3 and the depths extend from 4 to 16 km. The Friuli area is subdivided into ﬁve seismotectonic zones on the basis of tectonic characteristics, seismic activity and focal mechanisms, and for each zone a stress tensor is determined. The results show that the active tectonic stress in the Friuli area is heterogeneous and conditioned by the complex structural pattern, which is characterized by two indented tectonic wedges. The western and central parts of the area are mainly affected by a compressional state of stress, while in the eastern part a strike-slip state of stress prevails. The orientation of the principal stresses varies from the western to the eastern part of the area, and differences are also noticeable with depth. In the central part of the Friuli area the maximum compressional stress is N—S trending at shallow depths ({\textless}10 km), changing to NW—SE at deeper levels. The maximum compressional stress is NW—SE oriented in the western part, while in the eastern part it is N—S oriented.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Universal access to pulse oximetry worldwide is often limited by cost and has substantial public health consequences. Low-cost pulse oximeters have become increasingly available with limited regulatory agency oversight. The accuracy of these devices often has not been validated, raising questions about performance.
METHODS: The accuracy of 6 low-cost finger pulse oximeters during stable arterial oxygen saturations (Sao2) between 70\% and 100\% was evaluated in 22 healthy subjects. Oximeters tested were the Contec CMS50DL, Beijing Choice C20, Beijing Choice MD300C23, Starhealth SH-A3, Jumper FPD-500A, and Atlantean SB100 II. Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve 10 to 12 stable target Sao2 plateaus between 70\% and 100\% and Paco2 values of 35 to 45 mm Hg. Comparisons of pulse oximeter readings (Spo2) with arterial Sao2 (by Radiometer ABL90 and OSM3) were used to calculate bias (Spo2 – Sao2) mean, precision (SD of the bias), and root mean square error (ARMS).
RESULTS: Pulse oximeter readings corresponding to 536 blood samples were analyzed. Four of the 6 oximeters tested showed large errors (up to −6.30\% mean bias, precision 4.30\%, 7.53 ARMS) in estimating saturation when Sao2 was reduced {\textless}80\%, and half of the oximeters demonstrated large errors when estimating saturations between 80\% and 90\%. Two of the pulse oximeters tested (Contec CMS50DL and Beijing Choice C20) demonstrated ARMS of {\textless}3\% at Sao2 between 70\% and 100\%, thereby meeting International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria for accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Many low-cost pulse oximeters sold to consumers demonstrate highly inaccurate readings. Unexpectedly, the accuracy of some low-cost pulse oximeters tested here performed similarly to more expensive, ISO-cleared units when measuring hypoxia in healthy subjects. None of those tested here met World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists standards, and the ideal testing conditions do not necessarily translate these findings to the clinical setting. Nonetheless, further development of accurate, low-cost oximeters for use in clinical practice is feasible and, if pursued, could improve access to safe care, especially in lowincome countries.  (Anesth Analg 2016;123:338–45)},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Detailed knowledge of Holocene climate and glaciers dynamics is essential for sustainable development in warming mountain regions. Yet information about Holocene glacier coverage in the Alps before the Little Ice Age stems mostly from studying advances of glacier tongues at lower elevations. Here we present a new approach to reconstructing past glacier low stands and ice-free conditions by assessing and dating the oldest ice preserved at high elevations. A previously unexplored ice dome at Weißseespitze summit (3500 m), near where the “Tyrolean Iceman” was found, offers almost ideal conditions for preserving the original ice formed at the site. The glaciological settings and state-of-the-art micro-radiocarbon age constraints indicate that the summit has been glaciated for about 5900 years. In combination with known maximum ages of other high Alpine glaciers, we present evidence for an elevation gradient of neoglaciation onset. It reveals that in the Alps only the highest elevation sites remained ice-covered throughout the Holocene. Just before the life of the Iceman, high Alpine summits were emerging from nearly ice-free conditions, during the start of a Mid-Holocene neoglaciation. We demonstrate that, under specific circumstances, the old ice at the base of high Alpine glaciers is a sensitive archive of glacier change. However, under current melt rates the archive at Weißseespitze and at similar locations will be lost within the next two decades.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Nördlinger Ries and the Steinheim Basin are widely perceived as a Middle Miocene impact crater doublet. We discovered two independent earthquake-produced seismite horizons in North Alpine Foreland Basin deposits potentially related to both impacts. The older seismite horizon, demonstrated to be associated with the Ries impact, is overlain by distal impact ejecta in situ, forming a unique continental seismite-ejecta couplet within a distance of up to 180 km from the crater. The younger seismite unit, also produced by a major palaeo-earthquake, comprises clastic dikes that cut through the Ries seismite-ejecta couplet. The clastic dikes may have formed in response to the Steinheim impact, some kyr after the Ries impact, in line with paleontologic results that indicate a time gap of about 0.5 Myr between the Ries and Steinheim events. This interpretation suggests the Ries and Steinheim impacts represent two temporally separate events in Southern Germany that, thus, witnessed a double disaster in the Middle Miocene. The magnitude–distance relationship of seismite formation during large earthquakes suggests the seismic and destructive potential of impact-induced earthquakes may be underestimated.},

            The South China Sea (SCS) is a highly semi-enclosed marginal sea located in the East Asian monsoon region. This paper proposes interesting aspects of the unique feature of the SCS waves in response to tropical cyclone's passage when large-scale winter monsoon winds prevail. We use the wave model WaveWatch III to study the wave characteristics of typhoon Durian (2006) passing over the middle of SCS in early December 2006, and state the new understanding acquired in the aspects of the tropical cyclone generated waves in the SCS during winter monsoon surge. In light of this, the role of the large-scale NE monsoon winds on winter typhoon wave field characteristics in the SCS are highlighted by conducting sensitivity experiments with and without the NE monsoon winds. The NE monsoon winds weakly affect the SWH field near the typhoon track and strongly away from the track, especially in the deep water area of the northern SCS where the NE monsoon winds produce high waves. Comparisons between the two experiments show the effect of the NE monsoon winds on the directional wave spectra in the SCS, suggesting that the monsoon-generated swells do not decay and remain throughout the typhoon period.},

With all of these parameters measured, we calculated that fully grown penguins generate pressures of around 10 kPa (77 mm Hg) to expel watery material and 60 kPa (450 mm Hg) to expel material of higher viscosity similar to that of olive oil. The forces involved, lying well above those known for humans, are high, but do not lead to an energetically wasteful turbulent ﬂow. Whether a bird chooses the direction into which it decides to expel its faeces, and what role the wind plays in this, remain unknown.},

This permits a simple iterative approach to incompressible (or nearly incompressible) problems of fluid mechanics or solid mechanics and provides a stimulus for the use of such procedures in metal forming flow, etc.},

This paper shows by means of simple examples that problems can arise even for the simpler Stokes equations. The causes of the problem fall in either of two categories: round-off and ill conditioning, or a poor choice of pressure discretization. Nonsensical solutions can be obtained. Computation of the discrete divergence of the flow field is a simpleand powerful tool to diagnose such conditions. In the first part of the paper several simple techniques for minimizing the effect of round-off are reviewed. In the second part it is shown that, for coupled flow problems, care must be exercised in the choice of the pressure approximation. A unified treatment of various observations by different workers is presented. This should prove useful for general users of the finite element method.},

	abstract = {Geological and geochemical research in the internal zone of the Himalayan orogen reveal evidence for complex relationships between regional metamorphism, anatexis, thrust faulting and normal faulting in Miocene time. Such interactions share many characteristics with those that define the behaviour of non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems, like chemical oscillators. The internal ordering of such systems arises spontaneously and is maintained by continual exchange of energy with the outside world. Mountain ranges are open thermodynamic systems, equally capable of displaying selforganized behaviour. They accumulate energy through a variety of mechanisms, particularly crustal thickening, but their non-equilibrium structure is maintained through compensating mechanisms of energy dissipation. The simultaneous operation of normal faults and thrust faults in the Himalayan system, ejecting a wedge of middle crust southward from the orogen towards the Indian foreland, was a remarkably efficient method of mass (and therefore energy) dissipation in Miocene time. Research in many branches of science suggests that thermodynamic systems forced far from equilibrium by their boundary conditions may evolve towards establishing the most efficient possible mechanisms for counteracting those conditions. For the Himalaya, one possible explanation for development of a process set characterized by simultaneous normal faulting and thrust faulting, linked through metamorphism and anatexis, is that simple physical erosion alone was inadequate to lrmderate the extraordinary crustal thickness and topographic gradients that characterized the southern flank of the range in Miocene time. The orogenic system may have adapted to this condition through a new and more efficient mechanism of energy dissipation that required the coordination of a variety of thermal and deformational processes.},

	abstract = {Phase diagrams of hydrous mid-ocean ridge (MOR) basalts to 330 km depth and of hydrous peridotites to 250 km depth are compiled for conditions characteristic for subduction zones. A synthesis of our experimentally determined phase relations of chlorite, lawsonite, epidote-zoisite, amphibole, paragonite, chloritoid, talc, and phengite in basalts and of phase relations from the literature of serpentine, talc, chlorite, amphibole, and phase A in ultramaﬁcs permits calculation of H2O contents in hydrous phase assemblages that occur in natural compositions. This yields the information necessary to calculate water budgets for descending slabs. Starting from low-grade blueschist conditions (10–20 km depth) with H2O contents between 5 and 6 wt\% for hydrated oceanic crust, complete dehydration is achieved between 70 and {\textgreater}300 km depth as a function of individual slab geotherms. Hydrous phases which decompose at depth below volcanic arcs are lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, and talc (š phengite) in maﬁc compositions and chlorite and serpentine in peridotite. Approximately 15–35\% of the initially subducted H2O are released below volcanic arcs. The contribution of amphibole dehydration to the water budget is small (5–20\%) and occurs at relatively shallow depth (65–90 km). In any predicted thermal structure, dehydration is a combination of a stepwise and a continuous process through many different reactions which occur simultaneously in the different portions of the descending slab. Such a dehydration characteristic is incompatible with ‘single phase dehydration models’ which focus ﬂuid ﬂow through a unique major dehydration event in order to explain volcanic fronts. As a consequence of continuously progressing dehydration, water ascending from the slab will be generally available to depth of ca. 150–200 km. The ﬂuid rising from the subducting lithosphere will cause partial melting in the hot portion of the mantle wedge. We propose that the volcanic front simply forms above the mantle wedge isotherm where the extent of melting is sufﬁcient to allow for the mechanical extraction of parental arc magmas. Thermal models show that such an isotherm (ca. 1300ºC) locates below volcanic fronts, slab surface depths below such an isotherm are compatible with the observed depths of the slab surface below volcanic fronts. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, because of several issues that can affect the data, the HVSR cannot be considered as valid per se, and a careful data evaluation is necessary. In this study, a series of HVSR curves are evaluated in order to highlight industrial components that can signiﬁcantly alter the natural HVSR. First, a controlled-source experiment is carried out in order to deﬁne the characteristics of spurious industrial signals. Data analysis shows that the coherence functions and the mildly smoothed amplitude spectra plotted with linear scales can help signiﬁcantly in identifying industrial components that can be otherwise difﬁcult to highlight. Coherence functions appear particularly interesting because of their ability to reveal the presence of industrial components independently of their amplitude. Field data from three sites are then analyzed on the basis of the evidence obtained through the controlled-source experiment. For the third site, data recorded on two different days are considered. While in the ﬁrst data set no signiﬁcant industrial component is present, in the second and third data sets, a series of remarkable industrial signals that severely alter the natural HVSR are identiﬁed. The assessment of the coherence functions and mildly smoothed amplitude spectra is therefore suggested as a valuable support to avoid pitfalls in the interpretation of the experimental HVSR. Finally, two quick and dirty procedures aimed at reducing the effect of industrial components are also presented.},

            The accurate representation of data is essential in science communication. However, colour maps that visually distort data through uneven colour gradients or are unreadable to those with colour-vision deficiency remain prevalent in science.

We show how scientifically derived colour maps report true data variations, reduce complexity, and are accessible for people with colour-vision deficiencies. We highlight ways for the scientific community to identify and prevent the misuse of colour in science, and call for a proactive step away from colour misuse among the community, publishers, and the press.},

The water surface proﬁles and the discharges for ﬂow over side weirs, obtained with the proposed relation and valid for rectangular channels, are compared with experimental data for subcritical and supercritical ﬂow conditions. The validation of the method is accomplished by the comparison with the solution obtained by De Marchi’s classical hypothesis, about the speciﬁc energy, which is constant along a side weir.

This pedagogic study aimed to highlight potential biases in research on COVID-19 treatment. Methods: We evaluate the eﬀect of coﬀee’s active part, 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine (TMX) on patients with COVID-19. A cohort of 93 patients, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 is analyzed. Results: TMX group and control group included, respectively, 26 and 67 patients. In the TMX group, patients had a median length of stay in hospital of 5.5 days shorter than in the control group (9.5 vs. 15 days, p {\textless} 0.05). Patients in the control group were more severe than patients in the TMX group with a signiﬁcantly higher National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS-2 score) (8 vs. 6, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Multiple biases prevents us from concluding to an eﬀect of coﬀee on COVID-19. Despite an important social pressure during this crisis, methodology and conscientiousness are the best way to avoid hasty conclusions that can be deleterious for patients. Identiﬁer: NCT04395742.},

	abstract = {The static formation of air bubbles emanating from a submerged oriﬁce was analyzed based on the principles of force balance. The analysis was corroborated by experiments using a shadow imaging technique. The inﬂuence of the Young contact angle of the three material components was investigated by identifying two modes of formation, corresponding to bubble formation at the oriﬁce rim and spreading of the bubble base on the horizontal surface around the bubble. The characteristics of the formation process such as shape, height and volume of the bubble and the nondimensional pressure diﬀerence at the oriﬁce are given for both modes up to the critical equilibrium, deﬁned by the maximum bubble volume, at which the bubble releases dynamically.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

We present new observations of a candidate exomoon associated with Kepler-1625b using the Hubble Space Telescope to validate or refute the moon’s presence. We find evidence in favor of the moon hypothesis, based on timing deviations and a flux decrement from the star consistent with a large transiting exomoon. Self-consistent photodynamical modeling suggests that the planet is likely several Jupiter masses, while the exomoon has a mass and radius similar to Neptune. Since our inference is dominated by a single but highly precise Hubble epoch, we advocate for future monitoring of the system to check model predictions and confirm repetition of the moon-like signal.},

The order of magnitude of the maximum ice thickness is predicted using Weisskopf’s heuristic argument for the maximum height of a mountain, which involves only the specific latent heat of fusion and the acceleration of gravity. The local thickness of a glacier depends on the assumed ice rheology. The equations describing the steady state longitudinal glacier profile differ greatly for perfectly plastic ice and for ice following Glen’s law. Analytical solutions of these equations are derived: they fit well the data for ice caps but less so for alpine glaciers. Volume-area scaling, a major tool of glaciology, is discussed in relation with glacier profiles.},

	abstract = {Of all hypotheses advanced for why zebras have stripes, avoidance of biting fly attack receives by far the most support, yet the mechanisms by which stripes thwart landings are not yet understood. A logical and popular hypothesis is that stripes interfere with optic flow patterns needed by flying insects to execute controlled landings. This could occur through disrupting the radial symmetry of optic flow via the aperture effect (i.e. generation of false motion cues by straight edges), or through spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e. misregistration of repeated features) of evenly spaced stripes. By recording and reconstructing tabanid fly behaviour around horses wearing differently patterned rugs, we could tease out these hypotheses using realistic target stimuli. We found that flies avoided landing on, flew faster near, and did not approach as close to striped and checked rugs compared to grey. Our observations that flies avoided checked patterns in a similar way to stripes refutes the hypothesis that stripes disrupt optic flow via the aperture effect, which critically demands parallel striped patterns. Our data narrow the menu of fly-equid visual interactions that form the basis for the extraordinary colouration of zebras.},

To solve a problem they may simply look for an equation with the correct variables and assume it meets their needs, rather than selecting an equation that represents the appropriate physical process. These issues can be addressed by encouraging students to think of equations as stories, and to describe them in prose. This is the goal of the Equation Dictionary project, used in Western Washington University’s introductory geophysics course. Throughout the course, students create personal dictionaries consisting of (a) the equation itself, (b) a brief description of variables, (c) a prose description of the physical process described by the equation, and (d) additional notes that help them understand the equation. In writing these definitions students learn that equations are simplified descriptions of physical processes, and that understanding the process is more useful than memorizing a sequence of variables. Dictionaries also serve as formula sheets for exams, a task that encourages students to write meaningful, organized definitions. Furthermore, instructor review of the dictionaries is an excellent way to identify student misconceptions and learn how well they understand derivations and lectures.},

Three male construction workers were delivered to the emergency department with symptoms of food poisoning after ingestion of wild raw honey. Laboratory results showed that the 3 patients were at different degrees of renal damage, and 1 patient with severe symptoms died of acute renal failure 1 day after admission. Pollen analysis indicated that the suspected honey was heavily contaminated with TwHF pollen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for such poisoning. Pollen analysis is a practical approach to help diagnosis in remote areas where such honey poisoning occurs.},

Drug use is thought to be widespread among climbers attempting this summit, not only to prevent altitude illnesses, but also to boost physical and/or psychological capacities. This practice may be unsafe in this remote alpine environment. However, robust data on medication during the ascent of Mont Blanc are lacking. Individual urine samples from male climbers using urinals in mountain refuges on access routes to Mont Blanc (Goûter and Cosmiques mountain huts) were blindly and anonymously collected using a hidden automatic sampler. Urine samples were screened for a wide range of drugs, including diuretics, glucocorticoids, stimulants, hypnotics and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Out of 430 samples analyzed from both huts, 35.8\% contained at least one drug. Diuretics (22.7\%) and hypnotics (12.9\%) were the most frequently detected drugs, while glucocorticoids (3.5\%) and stimulants (3.1\%) were less commonly detected. None of the samples contained PDE-5 inhibitors. Two substances were predominant: the diuretic acetazolamide (20.6\%) and the hypnotic zolpidem (8.4\%). Thirty three samples were found positive for at least two substances, the most frequent combination being acetazolamide and a hypnotic (2.1\%). Based on a novel sampling technique, we demonstrate that about one third of the urine samples collected from a random sample of male climbers contained one or several drugs, suggesting frequent drug use amongst climbers ascending Mont Blanc. Our data suggest that medication primarily aims at mitigating the symptoms of altitude illnesses, rather than enhancing performance. In this hazardous environment, the relatively high prevalence of hypnotics must be highlighted, since these molecules may alter vigilance.},

The first was direct goring by the bison's horn, "hooking," resulting in deep puncture wounds most often to buttocks or thighs. Abdominal injury, including evisceration, was also seen. Blunt trauma occurred as the victim was shoved or butted by the animal's head, or when the victim sustained a rapid deceleration on ground impact after being tossed into the air. Multiple sites and types of fractures, abrasions, and contusions were seen. Most patients requiring hospital care for goring wounds were treated with operative debridement and primary closure. Cultures of puncture wounds were uniformly negative. Injuries from bison exceed injuries from bears or any other wild animals in Yellowstone National Park.},

Black bear attacks usually result in minor injuries and tend to be predacious. Polar bear attacks are ex.ceedingly rare, and the ferocity of polar bears has probably been overemphasized.

	abstract = {IntroductiondAlthough bear attacks on humans are uncommon, the incidence has slowly risen as human populations increasingly encroach on wilderness habitat. In the Kingdom of Bhutan, Himalayan black bear attacks occur regularly. Bears preferentially attack the face, often causing injuries that require surgical airway management. We sought to determine how often patients injured by Himalayan black bears required airway management during initial resuscitation.
MethodsdWe conducted a retrospective review of emergency department and admission records of the 3 referral hospitals in Bhutan. We identiﬁed all victims of bear attacks in Bhutan who received emergency airway management, including surgical airway management during the period from August 2013 to December 2017.
ResultsdThere were 21 patients who were treated for injuries from bear attacks during the study period. Of these, 12 required emergency airway management. Three patients who required emergency airways (2 intubations, 1 surgical airway) were attacked near a regional referral hospital and received care at that hospital. The remaining 9 patients received care from the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) retrieval team (1 intubation, 8 surgical airways).
ConclusionsdThe use of highly trained HEMS critical care retrieval teams may improve outcomes in critically injured patients who require time-critical airway management in remote areas. Countries such as Bhutan with populations far from emergency and critical care might beneﬁt from the establishment of HEMS critical care retrieval services. HEMS teams providing care while retrieving patients from austere environments should be expert in emergency airway management.},

	abstract = {Ankle fracture/dislocations are generally low-energy injuries most commonly seen in older adults. Prompt reduction is indicated when evacuation to deﬁnitive care would be prolonged or neurovascular compromise to the foot is suspected. Reduction restores neurovascular integrity, realigns joint contact surfaces, reduces pain, and decreases soft-tissue edema. The hematoma block is a safe, easy, and effective method of obtaining adequate anesthesia to allow manipulation of displaced fractures. Although most commonly used for distal radius fractures, the hematoma block has been demonstrated to be as effective as conscious sedation for ankle reduction analgesia. Use of hematoma block is ideal for the wilderness setting because it requires few supplies, is easy to perform, and is effective. Quigley’s traction consists of suspending the injured leg in a tubular fabric sling to allow gradual relaxation of deforming muscle forces and eventual reduction of a displaced ankle. For those displaced ankle fractures that are not amenable to reduction by direct manipulation, Quigley’s traction applied after hematoma block may allow successful reduction. Improvised Quigley’s traction can be built in a wilderness setting using available clothing. After successful reduction, fractured ankles should be adequately stabilized and the affected extremity should be kept nonweight bearing. The hematoma block and improvised Quigley’s traction are valuable skills for the wilderness medical provider and may facilitate a successful and relatively pain-free reduction of dislocated ankle fractures in a wilderness setting.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, a proliferation of interest has emerged in the area of avalanche survival, yielding both an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of death after avalanche burial and technological advances in the development of survival equipment. The dismal survival statistics born out of the modern era of winter recreation unmistakably reveal that elapsed time and depth of burial are the most critical variables of survival and the focus of newer survival devices on the market. Although blunt trauma may kill up to one third of avalanche victims, early asphyxiation is the predominant mechanism of death, and hypothermia is rare. A survival plateau or delay in asphyxiation may be seen in those buried in respiratory communication with an air pocket until a critical accumulation of CO2 or an ice lens develops. The newest survival devices available for adjunctive protection, along with a transceiver and shovel, are the artiﬁcial air pocket device (AvaLung), the avalanche air bag system (ABS), and the Avalanche Ball. The artiﬁcial air pocket prolongs adequate respiration during snow burial and may improve survival by delaying asphyxiation. The ABS, which forces the wearer to the surface of the avalanche debris by inverse segregation to help prevent burial, has been in use in Europe for the last 10 years with an impressive track record. Finally, the Avalanche Ball is a visual locator device in the form of a spring-loaded ball attached to a tether, which is released from a fanny pack by a rip cord. Despite the excitement surrounding these novel technologies, avalanche avoidance through knowledge and conservative judgment will always be the mainstay of avalanche survival, never to be replaced by any device.},

	abstract = {Background.—Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in North America. With nearly 2,500 Appalachian Trail (AT) hikers entering the endemic area for as long as 6 months, exposure to the disease is likely. The characteristic exanthem of erythema migrans (EM) should be a trigger for seeking medical treatment, and its recognition in this relatively isolated environment is important.
Objective.—The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of AT hikers to identify EM, the exanthem of Lyme disease.
Methods.—Hikers were administered a photographic stimulus in this Internal Review Board–approved pilot study. Historical hiking data, basic demographics, and self-reported treatment and diagnosis were collected.
Results.—In all, 379 responses were collected by 4 researchers at 3 geographically separate locations at or proximate to the AT from June 2011 to May 2012. Fifty-four percent of respondents (206 of 379) were able to recognize the photographs of EM/Lyme disease; 46\% could not. Of those who did recognize EM, 23 (6\%) had seen it either on themselves or on another hiker while on the AT. A total of 37 hikers stated that they had been diagnosed with Lyme disease while hiking, and of these, 89\% were treated with antibiotics. Thirteen of these 37 hikers (35\%) diagnosed with Lyme disease had visualized an embedded tick. Nine percent of all respondents reported they had been diagnosed with Lyme disease by a healthcare practitioner, whether from EM, symptomatology, or by titer.
Conclusions.—This study suggests that hikers are poorly able to recognize the characteristic exanthem of Lyme disease but have a high exposure risk.},

It is unknown whether permethrin treatment of a location, such as a campsite, provides passive prophylaxis reducing mosquito bites among all persons in the immediate vicinity.
Methods.—This randomized, double-blind controlled trial used 0.4\% permethrin (2.5\% permethrin diluted by 7 parts water) sprayed once onto the external surface of canvas tents at a Boy Scout summer camp. During a 9-week period, subjects (n ϭ 545) completed nightly mosquito-bite and -landing counts for 5 minutes at dusk and recorded insect-repellent use within 2 hours of counting. Weekly mosquito sampling with CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traps occurred at study campsites. The primary outcome measure was the number of mosquito bites per 5 minutes.
Results.—A total of 1614 person nights averaged 5.1 Ϯ 7.2 (ϮSD) mosquito bites per 5 minutes. The permethrin-treated campsites had decreased mosquito landings and bites (relative risk reduction [RRR] 44\%; 95\% CI 34\% to 55\%; P Ͻ .001) compared with controls. Insect repellent was used only 32\% of nights, decreasing bites by 36\% (RRR 36\%; 95\% CI 25\% to 47\%; P Ͻ .001). Permethrin was superior to insect repellent alone (RRR 20\%; 95\% CI 4\% to 37\%; P ϭ .01).
Conclusions.—Permethrin treatment of tents is an effective, inexpensive public health measure to reduce mosquito bites. Permethrin is effective among all individuals in a camping setting and was more effective than topical insect repellent alone, which, although recommended, was inconsistently used.},

	abstract = {Objective.—A paucity of data exists regarding the use of iodophores such as povidone-iodine (PVI) to disinfect water. We sought to determine a practical minimal disinfecting concentration of 10\% PVI over different contact times and temperatures when added to water inoculated with E. coli.
Methods.—1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 dilutions of 10\% PVI were created. Escherichia coli was exposed to these dilutions for 5, 15, and 30 minutes at 10, 20, and 30oC. Bactericidal activity was neutralized with 0.5\% sodium thiosulfate. Mean viable colony forming units (CFUs) was determined after triplicate plating on Luria-bertani agar and 24 hours of incubation at 37oC. Effective bactericidal activity was deﬁned as a 5-log reduction.
Results.—Of the 200,000 E. coli plated, no CFUs were observed after exposure to the 1:100 dilution. After 5 minutes of contact time with the 1:1,000 dilution, at 10oC CFUs were too numerous to count (TNTC), at 20oC the mean CFU count was 92 (standard error Ϯ11), and at 30oC the mean CFU count was 25 (standard error Ϯ8). No CFUs were observed after 15 minutes of exposure to the 1:1,000 dilution across experimental temperatures. The 1:10,000 dilution always yielded CFU growth that was TNTC.
Conclusions.—The lowest disinfecting concentration of 10\% PVI was the 1:1,000 dilution at 15 minutes of contact time. This supports the use of PVI for water disinfection against E. coli, the organism most commonly responsible for traveler’s diarrhea. Further studies may assess its effectiveness against more virulent water borne pathogens.},

	abstract = {Objective.—Topical repellents can provide effective personal protection from tick-borne diseases by preventing the attachment of ticks. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a commercially available repellent spray containing both N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, previously known as N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and ethyl-butylacetylaminopropionate (EBAAP) against tick bites in a population at risk in Switzerland under real-life conditions.
Methods.—The effectiveness of an insect repellent spray containing both DEET and EBAAP was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ﬁeld study. The study, requiring simple application of the repellent to exposed skin, was carried out on 276 forestry workers and orienteers under everyday conditions in Switzerland from May to September 1999. We measured total effectiveness of the repellent by the following formula: percentage effectiveness ϭ 100 ϫ (TP Ϫ TR)/TP, where TP and TR were the average number of ticks per hour spent in wooded areas for the repellent and placebo groups, respectively.
Results.—The average number of tick bites per hour of exposure to wooded areas differed significantly between the placebo (n ϭ 138) and repellent (n ϭ 138) groups, 0.17 vs 0.10 (P Ͻ .05). Total repellent effectiveness against tick attachment was 41.1\% (95\% CI, 2.5–79.6). On the arms, an effectiveness of 66\% (95\% CI, 17.3–114.7) was observed. No signiﬁcant difference in the average number of unattached ticks could be found.
Conclusions.—This study found that an easily applied repellent is moderately effective in reducing the risk of tick bites.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions are fundamentally uncertain because no proxy is a direct record of a single environmental variable of interest; all proxies are indirect and sensitive to multiple forcing factors. One productive approach to reducing proxy uncertainty is the integration of information from multiple proxy systems with complementary, overlapping sensitivity. Mostly, such analyses are conducted in an ad hoc fashion, either through qualitative comparison to assess the similarity of single-proxy reconstructions or through step-wise quantitative interpretations where one proxy is used to constrain a variable relevant to the interpretation of a second proxy. Here we propose the integration of multiple proxies via the joint inversion of proxy system and paleoenvironmental time series models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The “Joint Proxy Inversion” (JPI) method provides a statistically robust approach to producing self-consistent interpretations of multi-proxy datasets, allowing full and simultaneous assessment of all proxy and model uncertainties to obtain quantitative estimates of past environmental conditions. Other benefits of the method include the ability to use independent information on climate and environmental systems to inform the interpretation of proxy data, to fully leverage information from unevenly and differently sampled proxy records, and to obtain refined estimates of proxy model parameters that are conditioned on paleo-archive data. Application of JPI to the marine Mg∕Ca and δ18O proxy systems at two distinct timescales demonstrates many of the key properties, benefits, and sensitivities of the method, and it produces new,
statistically grounded reconstructions of Neogene ocean temperature and chemistry from previously published data. We suggest that JPI is a
universally applicable method that can be implemented using proxy models of
wide-ranging complexity to generate more robust, quantitative understanding
of past climatic and environmental change.},

	abstract = {Many students, especially in econometrics, express frustration with the way a problem known as “bad control” is evaded, if not mishandled, in the traditional literature. The problem arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coeﬃcient and the eﬀect that the coeﬃcient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

	abstract = {Camera traps have become an important research tool for both conservation biologists and wildlife managers. Recent advances in spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have increasingly put camera traps at the forefront of population monitoring programs. These methods allow for benchmark analysis of species density without the need for invasive ﬁeldwork techniques. We conducted a review of SECR studies using camera traps to summarize the current focus of these investigations, as well as provide recommendations for future studies and identify areas in need of future investigation. Our analysis shows a strong bias in species preference, with a large proportion of studies focusing on large felids, many of which provide the only baseline estimates of population density for these species. Furthermore, we found that a majority of studies produced density estimates that may not be precise enough for long-term population monitoring. We recommend simulation and power analysis be conducted before initiating any particular study design and provide examples using readily available software. Furthermore, we show that precision can be increased by including a larger study area that will subsequently increase the number of individuals photo-captured. As many current studies lack the resources or manpower to accomplish such an increase in effort, we recommend that researchers incorporate new technologies such as machine-learning, web-based data entry, and online deployment management into their study design. We also cautiously recommend the potential of citizen science to help address these study design concerns. In addition, modiﬁcations in SECR model development to include species that have only a subset of individuals available for individual identiﬁcation (often called mark-resight models), can extend the process of explicit density estimation through camera trapping to species not individually identiﬁable.},

Current guidelines emphasize developing statistical thinking in students and exposing them to the entire investigative process in the context of interesting research questions and real data. As a result, many concepts (confounding, multivariable models, study design, etc.) previously reserved only for higherlevel courses now appear in introductory courses. Despite these changes, causality is rarely discussed in introductory courses, except for warning students “correlation does not imply causation” or covering the special case of randomized controlled experiments. In this article, we argue causal inference concepts align well with statistics education guidelines for introductory courses by developing statistical and multivariable thinking, exposing students to many aspects of the investigative process, and fostering active learning. We discuss how to integrate causal inference concepts into introductory courses using causal diagrams and provide an illustrative example with youth smoking data. Through our website, we also provide a guided student activity and instructor resources. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models.

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

Economic applications include the volumetric evaluation of components in building stones, road-metals, sSlid fuels, refractories, and slags.
The object of this new design is to combine speed and accuracy in operation with a particularly compact construction, mechanical simplicity, and strength. Special consideration has been given to the wear and cleansing of bearings, the definition of scale-divisions and zero-marks, and the rigidity of all supports for moving parts.},

	doi = {10.1086/626295},
	abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores indicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent periodic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Günzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Giinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.1° C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.8° C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temperature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedimentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years occurred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is necessary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.},

Once glacier entities are defined and an appropriate DTM is available, several methods exist to derive the inventory data (e.g. minimum, maximum and mean elevation; mean slope and aspect) for each glacier from digital intersection of both datasets. Compared to the former manual methods, the new grid-based statistical calculations are very fast and reproducible. The major aim of this contribution is to help in standardizing the related calculations to enhance the integrity of the Global Land Ice Monitoring from Space (GLIMS) database. The recommendations were prepared by a working group and also contribute to the European Space Agency project GlobGlacier. The document follows the former UNESCO manual for the production of the World Glacier Inventory published in 1970, identifies the potential pitfalls, and describes the differences from the former methods of compilation.

We explain the process of computationally reconstructing three-d imensional (3D) images from 2D radiographs and how to segment the 3D images for subsequent visualization and quantification. Whereas CT is widely used in medical and heavy industrial contexts at relatively low resolutions, here we focus on the application of higher resolution X-r ay CT across science and engineering. We consider the application of X-ray CT to study subjects across the materials, metrology and manufacturing, engineering, food, biological, geological and palaeontological sciences. We examine how CT can be used to follow the structural evolution of materials in three dimensions in real time or in a time-lapse manner, for example to follow materials manufacturing or the in-s ervice behaviour and degradation of manufactured components. Finally, we consider the potential for radiation damage and common sources of imaging artefacts, discuss reproducibility issues and consider future advances and opportunities.},

Over 60 papers since 1988 have been published in the glaciological and environmental change literature containing applications of volume-area scaling, mostly for the purpose of estimating total global glacier and ice cap volume and modeling future contributions to sea level rise from glaciers and ice caps. The application of the theory is not entirely straightforward, however, and many of the recently published results contain analyses that are in conﬂict with the theory as originally described by Bahr et al. (1997). In this review we describe the general theory of scaling for glaciers in full three-dimensional detail without simpliﬁcations, including an improved derivation of both the volume-area scaling exponent γ and a new derivation of the multiplicative scaling parameter c. We discuss some common misconceptions of the theory, presenting examples of both appropriate and inappropriate applications. We also discuss potential future developments in power law scaling beyond its present uses, the relationship between power law scaling and other modeling approaches, and some of the advantages and limitations of scaling techniques.},

The instability observed under a wide variety of experimental conditions has been analyzed, and the initial phases have been found to agree well with the first-order theory given in part I. When the disturbance has attained a considerable amplitude the first-order equations cease to apply and it changes from a wave into a form which has the appearance of large round-ended columns of air extending into the liquid and separated by narrow sheets of liquid. The air columns attain a steady velocity relative to the accelerating liquid and continue to penetrate into the liquid until the lower surface of the liquid is reached. In spite of these very large surface disturbances, the main body of liquid below them is accelerated as though they did not exist.},

The map was created following the guidelines of the Italian Geomorphological Working Group for landforms symbolic representation. This includes an immediate visual diﬀerentiationof the genetic character and the state of activity of landforms. Favignana, belonging to the Egadi Archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea (SW Italy), is a mid-sized (ca. 20 km2) mostly carbonatic island. The marine protected area surrounding the island represents the main attraction for tourists. Through this map, it was possible to highlight the richness and diversity, in terms of abundance and peculiarity of landforms, that characterizes the Island. This peculiarity makes of Favignana an excellent candidate for the exploitation of its geoheritage for touristic purposes.},

	abstract = {Camera images and video recordings are simple and non-invasive tools to investigate animals in their natural habitat. Quantitative evaluations, however, often require an exact reconstruction of object positions, sizes, and distances in the image. Here, we provide an open source software package to perform such calculations. Our approach allows the user to correct for perspective distortion, transform images to ‘‘bird’s-eye" view projections, or transform image-coordinates to real-world coordinates and vice versa. The extrinsic camera parameters that are necessary to perform such image corrections and transformations (elevation, tilt/roll angle, and heading of the camera) are obtained from the image using contextual information such as a visible horizon, GPS coordinates of landmarks, known object sizes, or images of the same object obtained from different viewing angles. All mathematical operations are implemented in the Python package CameraTransform. The performance of the implementation is evaluated using computer-generated synthetic images with known camera parameters. Moreover, we test our algorithm on images of emperor penguin colonies, and demonstrate that the camera tilt and roll angles can be estimated with an error of less than one degree, and the camera elevation with an error of less than 5\%. The CameraTransform software package simplifies camera matrix-based image transformations and the extraction of quantitative image information. An extensive documentation and usage examples in an ecological context are provided at http://cameratransform.readthedocs.io.},

	abstract = {Background Some authors have proposed different predictive factors of severe acute cholecystitis, but generally, the results of risk analyses are expressed as odds ratios, which makes it difficult to apply in the clinical practice of the acute care surgeon. The severe form of acute cholecystitis should include both gangrenous and phlegmonous cholecystitis, due to their severe clinical course, and cholecystectomy should not be delayed. The aim of this study was to create a nomogram to obtain a graphical tool to compute the probability of having a severe acute cholecystitis.
Methods This is a retrospective study on 393 patients who underwent emergency cholecystectomy between January 2010 and December 2015 at the Acute Care Surgery Service of the S. Anna University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy. Patients were classified as having a non-severe acute cholecystitis or a severe acute cholecystitis (i.e., gangrenous and phlegmonous) based on the final pathology report. The baseline characteristics, pre-operative signs, and abdominal ultrasound (US) findings were assessed with a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the risk of severe acute cholecystitis, and a nomogram was created.
Results Age as a continuous variable, WBC count ≥ 12.4 × 103/μl, CRP ≥9.9 mg/dl, and presence of US thickening of the gallbladder wall were significantly associated with severe acute cholecystitis at final pathology report. A significant interaction between the effect of age and CRP was found. Four risk classes were identified based on the nomogram total points.
Conclusions Patients with a nomogram total point ≥ 74 should be considered at high risk of severe acute cholecystitis (at 74 total point, sensitivity = 78.5\%; specificity = 78.2\%; accuracy = 78.3\%) and this finding could be useful for surgical planning once confirmed in a prospective study comparing the risk score stratification and clinical outcomes.},

This article reviews life-course data analysis methods for modeling these trajectories, as well as their application in studies of antisocial behavior and of crime in childhood, in adolescence, and throughout life. We set the stage by introducing growth curve (hierarchical linear) models. We focus our review on ﬁnite mixture models for life-course data, known as group-based trajectory and growth mixture models. We then discuss how these models are applied within criminology and developmental psychology, recent controversies over their substantive use and interpretation, and important issues of statistical practice and the challenges they raise. Building on the critical literature, we offer several recommendations for the applied users of the models. Finally, we present the most recent method of examining behavioral trajectories in criminology, the unimodal curve registration (UCR) approach. We brieﬂy contrast the UCR model with growth curve and ﬁnite mixture models for life-course data analysis.},

	abstract = {Humans occupy a wider range of environments, process more energy, and have greater biomass than any other species because we are able to culturally evolve complex, locally adaptive technologies.1 Competing models make different predictions about the role of causal knowledge in this process. Some argue that innovation and transmission cannot occur without causal understanding,2–5 while others posit that complex technologies can evolve without causal understanding.1,6–10 Prior research on this topic has been restricted to theoretical work and experimental studies with student participants.11–13 The Hadza are foragers who rely on bows for subsistence.14–16 We interviewed skilled Hadza bowyers (bow-makers) and compared their beliefs regarding the tradeoffs in bow construction to those revealed by experimental and engineering research. If bowyers understand the tradeoffs, it is plausible that cultural evolution is rooted in causal understanding, while if they do not, the cultural accumulation of knowledge is likely more important in the process. We show that Hadza bowyers understand some mechanical trade-offs but not others, and therefore the evolution of a complex, highly adaptive technology is possible with incomplete causal knowledge regarding key mechanical trade-offs. Instead, some important design choices made by subjects seem to reﬂect cultural norms. Although previously published reports have suggested that some individuals are recognized by the Hadza as being especially skilled or knowledgeable,14,17 our results do not indicate that some individuals are significantly more knowledgeable about bow-making than others, nor is there statistical evidence that causal knowledge increases with age.},

	abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of speci®c applications. However, in any speci®c application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the speci®c context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of ®tting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc ®tting, and after calibration the model is used, with the ®tted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the ®tted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-®tting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

Erosional and scattered paleosol evidences beneath the sands are consistent with an emersion interval following the already recognized tectonic phase.

It is suggested to limit the use of the term "sabbie gialle" formation to the littoral foreshore to shoreface sandy facies (plus minor heteropic bodies) overlying the unconformity.

	abstract = {We review the systematic uncertainties that have plagued attempts to obtain high precision and high accuracy from ground-based photometric measurements using CCDs. We identify two main challenges in breaking through the 1\% precision barrier: (1) fully characterizing atmospheric transmission, along the instrument’s line of sight, and (2) properly identifying, measuring, and removing instrumental artifacts. We discuss approximations and limitations inherent in the present methodology, and we estimate their contributions to systematic photometric uncertainties. We propose an alternative conceptual scheme for the relative calibration of astronomical apparatus: the availability of calibrated detectors whose relative spectral sensitivity is known to better than one part in 103 opens up the possibility of in situ relative throughput measurements, normalized to a precision calibrated detector, using a stable but uncalibrated narrowband light source. An implementation scheme is outlined, which exploits the availability of tunable lasers to map out the relative wavelength response of an imaging system, using a ﬂat-ﬁeld screen and a calibrated reference photodiode. The merits and limitations of this scheme are discussed. In tandem with careful measurements of atmospheric transmission, this approach could potentially lead to reliable ground-based photometry with fractional uncertainties below the percent level.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm to photometrically calibrate wide ﬁeld optical imaging surveys, that simultaneously solves for the calibration parameters and relative stellar ﬂuxes using overlapping observations. The algorithm decouples the problem of “relative” calibrations from that of “absolute” calibrations; the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire survey. We pay special attention to the spatial structure of the calibration errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses. Applying this to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging data, we achieve ∼ 1\% relative calibration errors across 8500 deg2 in griz; the errors are ∼ 2\% for the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodelled atmospheric variations at Apache Point Observatory. These calibrations, dubbed “ubercalibration”, are now public with SDSS Data Release 6, and will be a part of subsequent SDSS data releases.},

With a half-life of 5,700 ± 30 years, detection of 14C is a useful tool for determining the age of a specimen formed over the past 55,000 years. In this Primer, we outline key advances in 14C measurement and instrument capacity, as well as optimal sample selection and preparation. We discuss data processing, carbon reservoir age correction, calibration and statistical analyses. We then outline examples of radiocarbon dating across a range of applications, from anthropology and palaeoclimatology to forensics and medical science. Reproducibility and minimum reporting standards are discussed along with potential issues related to accuracy and sensitivity. Finally, we look forwards to the adoption of radiocarbon dating in various fields of research thanks to continued instrument improvement.},

Here we present the ﬁrst probabilistic inversion framework capable of inverting both trace and major element data of maﬁc volcanic rocks to constrain mantle potential temperature, depth of melting, and major and trace element source composition. The inversion strategy is based on the combination of (i) a two-phase multicomponent reactive transport model, (ii) a thermodynamic solver for the evolution of major elements and mineral/liquid phases, (iii) a disequilibrium model of trace element partitioning and (iv) an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The mechanical and chemical evolution of melt and solid residue are therefore modelled in an internally- and thermodynamically-consistent manner.},

	abstract = {During the Viking extended mission the following were performed: (1) The backhoe magnets on Viking Lander (VL) 2 were successfully cleaned, followed by a test involving successive insertions of the cleaned backhoe into the surface. Rapid saturation of the magnets confirmed evidence from primary mission results that the magnetic mineral in the Martian surface is widely distributed, most probably in the form of composite particles of magnetic and nonmagnetic minerals. (2) An image of the VL 2 backhoe taken via the ?4 magnifying mirror demonstrates the fine-grained nature of the attracted magnetic material. (3) The reference test chart magnet on VL 1, and by inference also on VL 2, continued to attract magnetic particles from the Martian atmosphere. The new results generally are in agreement with previous estimates of 1?7\% of magnetic mineral, probably maghemite, in the surface material. The presence of maghemite and its occurrence as a pigment in, or a thin coating on, all mineral particles or as discrete, finely divided and widely distributed crystallites, are consistent with data from the inorganic analysis experiments and with laboratory simulations of results of the biology experiments on Mars.},

	abstract = {Persistent desiccation and contraction of muddy sediments gives rise to mud cracks. These cracks form networks of interconnected tension fractures arranged in remarkable polygonal patterns. Because tensile stress due to drying declines downwards through the sediment, mud cracks have generally been theorized to nucleate near the surface, propagate downwards, and terminate at depth. Here I trace the nucleation and growth path of natural mud cracks by analyzing in detail crack-surface morphology. The present observations show that systematic nucleation at the bottom of the polygons and upward propagation of mud cracks are much more prevalent than previously postulated. The cracks predominantly rupture the desiccated layers before they significantly extend laterally and sequentially form the polygonal patterns. The consistent location of crack origins at depth, along the bottom of the polygons, strongly suggests that stress concentration at flaw discontinuities and layer boundaries play a fundamental role during mud fracturing.},

	abstract = {A lattice solid model is presented that is capable of simulating the nonlinear dynamical processes (friction and fracture) associated with earthquakes. It is based on molecular dynamics principles to model interacting particles by numerically solving their equations of motion. Particles represent indivisible units of the system such as grains and interactions are described through effective potential functions. In this initial work, particles interact through radial pairwise potentials and the solid is made of particles arranged in a two–dimensional triangular lattice which corresponds to an isotropic elastic medium in the macroscopic limit. Simple and tractable potentials are specified to model brittle and ductile material. Numerical experiments of flawed brittle and ductile blocks subjected to uni–axial compression yield mode II fracturing behavior and characteristic stress–strain curves. In another experiment involving brittle blocks with rough surfaces being dragged past one another, stick–slip frictional behavior is observed. These results suggest that earthquakes can be simulated using the particle based modeling approaches even when the particles and their interactions are highly simplified.},

	abstract = {A two -dimensional, discrete- element modelling technique is used to investigate the initiation and growth of detachment folds in sedimentary rocks above a weak de¤ collement level.The model depicts the sedimentary rocks as an assemblage of spheres that obey Newton’s equations of motion and that interact with elastic forces under the in£uence of gravity. Faulting or fracturing between neighbouring elements is represented by a transition from repulsive{\textasciicircum}attractive forces to solely repulsive forces.The sedimentary sequence is mechanically heterogeneous, consisting of intercalated layers of markedly di¡erent strengths and thicknesses.The interlayering of weak and strong layers within the sedimentary rocks promotes the localization of £exural £ow deformation within the weak layers. Even with simple displacement boundary conditions, and straightforward interlayering of weak and strong layers, the structural geometries that develop are complex, with a combination of box, lift- o¡ and disharmonic detachment fold styles forming above the de¤ collement. In detail, it is found that the modelled folds grow by both limb rotation and limb lengthening.The combination of these two mechanisms results in uplift patterns above the folds that are di⁄cult, or misleading, to interpret in terms of simple kinematic models. Comparison of modelling results with natural examples and with kinematic models highlights the complexities of structural interpretation in such settings.},

	abstract = {Powder diffraction is a non-destructive technique, which is experimentally simple in principle. Because the physics behind diffraction is well understood, an exceptionally large amount of information can be obtained from a single measurement. The positions and relative intensities of the peaks yield a fingerprint that can be used for qualitative phase analysis. Quantitative phase analysis can be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensities. Unit cells can be derived from the peak positions. Crystal structures can be solved using powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The peak profiles contain information about crystallite size, strain and nanostructure. Non-idealities in the intensities give information on texture. Abandoning the crystallographic model provides information about local structure, by pair distribution function analysis. For powder diffraction, everything is a sample; the technique is commonly applied to characterize minerals, ceramics, metals and alloys, catalysts, polymers, pharmaceuticals, organic compounds, environmental and forensic samples, among others. The major features of contemporary laboratory powder diffractometers are described. Methods for obtaining suitable powder specimens are summarized. Major applications of qualitative and quantitative phase analysis, structure solution, size/strain/nanostructure analysis using peak profiles, texture analysis and pair distribution function analysis are introduced.},

	abstract = {Geographers and geologists, although not yet constituted as formal professions but already representing two significant sections of the Natural Science Faculty in the University, gave their specialized contributions to the Italian struggle all along World War One. For decades before the war actually started, geographers had conceived and perfected the concept of «natural border» that would make the northern and eastern crests of the Alps the boundary between the Italian cultural area and the areas inhabited by Germans, Slovenians and Croatians. Moreover, geographers contributed to the warfare by publishing political and scientific essays, which would popularize the «natural border» concept to root it into the people during the deals for peace treaties that would follow the partition of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, one of them, Cesare Battisti, who took part to the battle, paid with his life his dedication to recovering Trentino to the homeland. The contribution of geologists to warfare is less clear, because geologists were at that time not yet clearly distinguishable from either geographers or engineers. Therefore, while most geologists mobilized as full members of the Engineering Corps, others contributed as civil temporary aggregates in developing ore production, so that Italy would cope with the enormous deficit, which very large import of essential war materials and foodstuff had created. A typical attempt of making use for export of Italian minerals not easily available to the European allies occurred at Lurisia, near Cuneo. In August 1918 Marie Curie visited the Lurisia site and the Nivolano radioactive waters as a possible source of radium and «émanation» (= radon) to be used in post-war recovery, but lack of industrial interest resulting from careful geological and mineralogical surveys after the war suggested dismissing the mine claim and transforming the Lurisia site into a spa.},

	abstract = {Il presente lavoro di tesi si inquadra nel programma di rilevamento geologico del Foglio 027 Bolzano, nell’area della Val di Tires – Passo Nigra, Alta Val d’Ega (Bolzano), la cui realizzazione è in corso a cura della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano, nell’ambito del progetto CARG.  Durante la campagna di rilevamento sono stati prelevati 33 campioni presso Tires, in Alta Val d’Ega, appartenenti alle vulcaniti permiane del Gruppo Vulcanico Atesino (GVA), 18 dei quali sono stati sottoposti ad analisi ottico-petrografica e chimica in XRF.  I campioni sono stati prelevati dalle tre principali formazioni geologiche affioranti nell’area: la Formazione di Gargazzone (IGG), la Formazione di Cornedo (COR) e la Formazione di Ora (ORA).   Dalle analisi è emerso che i campioni prelevati dalla Formazione di Gargazzone risultano di composizione riodacitica, quelli della Formazione di Cornedo hanno composizione andesitica e andesitico-dacitica, quelli della Formazione di Ora hanno composizione riolitica e riodacitica.  Sono state distinte tre litofacies all’interno della Formazione di Ora: una litofacies basale, caratterizzata da un’elevata concentrazione di componenti litiche; una litofacies intermedia, decisamente più massiccia ed omogenea, che presenta al suo interno sporadici corpi lenticolari di ignimbriti ricche in pomici; una litofacies di tetto, ricca in pomici.  Generalmente le ignimbriti della Formazione di Ora si caratterizzano per la composizione riolitica ricca in sanidino, ma la presenza di ignimbriti di composizione riodacitica all’interno della formazione e precisamente nell’area di studio, si può imputare alla modificazione della composizione mineralogica e chimica originaria a causa dei fenomeni metasomatici, particolarmente intensi lungo il bordo calderico.  Sono stati inoltre prelevati cinque campioni che tagliano le formazioni affioranti, due dei quali hanno composizione riolitica, due hanno composizione basaltica e uno ha composizione alcali-basaltica.},

	abstract = {Il lavoro di questa tesina consiste nello studio ottico-petrografico e geochimico di venti campioni di vulcaniti permiane appartenenti al Gruppo Vulcanico Atesino (GVA). Diciotto di queste ricadono nella porzione nord orientale del Foglio 27 Bolzano e due nell’adiacente Foglio 14 Bressanone.  I campioni sono stati raccolti durante le campagne di rilevamento effettuate per il Servizio Geologico della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano nell’ambito del progetto CARG.  I campioni studiati sono profondamente affetti da processi metasomatici che hanno modificato sensibilmente la loro composizione. E stato necessario eseguire un accurato confronto fra l’esame petrografico in sezione sottile e le analisi geochimiche (in XRF) per ottenere la classificazione corretta dei campioni. Le analisi effettuate hanno consentito di attribuire i campioni alle formazioni vulcaniche affioranti nel settore settentrionale del Gruppo Vulcanico Atesino.  La sequenza vulcanica è compresa tra due discordanze di primo ordine: quella inferiore sul basamento metamorfico Varisico Sudalpino, mentre quella superiore con i depositi clastici continentali permiani caratterizzati dalla base erosiva delle facies conglomeratiche che costituiscono le Arenarie della Val Gardena (AVG). Escludendo due campioni di arenaria, lo studio e la classificazione geochimica dei prodotti vulcanici hanno evidenziato che tutti i campioni presentano composizioni subalcaline di carattere dacitico, riolitico/ riodacitico. Un solo campione è risultato essere un’andesite.},

Le rocce sono state campionate in sito per essere poi analizzate in laboratorio con diverse tecniche: osservazioni delle sezioni sottili e microanalisi al SEM (microscopio elettronico a scansione).  Sono stati raccolti un totale di otto campioni. Da questi si sono ricavate sette sezioni sottili ed una sezione lucida. Ognuno di questi campioni si è dimostrato molto alterato e tettonizzato, cosa prevedibile già dal rilevamento in campagna dato che la maggior parte delle rocce campionate tendevano molto facilmente a sgretolarsi.  Le rocce si sono dimostrate essere brecce, serpentiniti e basalti.  Osservando le sezioni sottili si è potuto notare che alcuni campioni risultavano completamente impregnati di calcite, in altri i minerali originali (come le olivine e i pirosseni) sono stati totalmente sostituiti e di loro restano a malapena pochi relitti, in altri ancora era presente una diffusa ossidazione.  Dalla microanalisi della sezione di un basalto è emersa la completa albitizzazione dei plagioclasi ed è stata stabilita la natura fondamentalmente augitica dei pirosseni.},

	url = {http://amslaurea.unibo.it/8919/},
	abstract = {Il Mar Ionio è una delle zone tettonicamente più attive del Mediterraneo e per questo rappresenta un’area ottimale per studiare i rapporti tra sedimentazione e tettonica. Più del 90\% dei sedimenti quaternari del Mar Ionio sono costituiti da unità torbiditiche messe in posto da sismi, in particolare, uno di questi depositi è definito “Homogenite” oppure “HAT” (Homogenite/Augias Turbidite), riferibile al terremoto/tsunami di Creta del 365 d.C..  In questo contesto, l’analisi delle associazioni a foraminiferi bentonici all’interno delle unità torbiditiche può fornire utili indicazioni riguardo ai paleoambienti di provenienza del sedimento. Lo scopo della tesi è studiare le associazioni a foraminiferi presenti all’interno del sondaggio CQ14\_01, prelevato nel Mar Ionio a 3793 m di profondità, nel prisma di accrezione calabro e che presenta una successione riferibile alla HAT dello spessore di circa 7 m.  All’interno della HAT, le analisi micropaleontologiche hanno evidenziato la presenza di una cospicua quantità di foraminiferi bentonici di dimensioni comprese tra 63 e 125 µm, costituite principalmente da specie presenti in un ampio intervallo batimetrico e subordinatamente da taxa tipici di piattaforma interna (principalmente Patellina corrugata, Spirillina vivipara e Rosalina spp.). La presenza di una quantità relativamente abbondante di taxa di piattaforma interna suggerisce che sia stata l'onda di ritorno dello tsunami a innescare la torbidite, mentre l'onda di andata avrebbe prodotto la rimobilizzazione del sedimento di piattaforma. Un simile modello di innesco delle torbiditi legate a tsunami è stato elaborato per spiegare alcune torbiditi messe in posto a seguito dell'evento sismico di Tohoku-Oki del 2011 (Arai et al., 2013). Lo studio eseguito in questa Tesi suggerisce che l’analisi delle associazioni a foraminiferi in depositi torbiditici può costituire uno strumento utile per determinare i paleoambenti di provenienza dei fossili e probabilmente anche per ricostruire le modalità di innesco e di messa in posto dei flussi torbiditici.},

	abstract = {Il sito archeologico di Grotta di Fumane (Verona) riveste un ruolo di rilievo in Europa per via delle numerose e importanti testimonianze sulla vita dei neandertaliani e dei primi Homo sapiens nel Pleistocene superiore. Nello specifico sono stati analizzati i resti malacologici provenienti dai livelli protoaurignaziani e aurignaziani della grotta. Gli obiettivi di questo studio sono: 1) effettuare una revisione tassonomica per le specie di molluschi presenti nella collezione; 2) reperire informazioni sulle attuali aree di approvvigionamento degli stessi e 3) studiarne le caratteristiche morfologiche ed ecologiche al fine di determinare criteri di scelta delle conchiglie e comprenderne l’utilizzo da parte di H. sapiens. A tal fine è stata eseguita una attività di ricerca online tramite i siti “World Register of Marine Species” (WoRMS) e del “Censimento della Malacofauna marina italiana” del Centro ENEA - Santa Teresa (La Spezia), inoltre è stata consultata letteratura specialistica. La revisione tassonomica ha evidenziato che tre specie sul totale hanno attualmente una nomenclatura binomiale differente. Il 91\% delle specie si trova lungo le coste italiane. Circa il 68\% dei ritrovamenti ricadono nei primi 10 metri di profondità (spiaggia). Il 67.7\% circa dei ritrovamenti è stata reperita su fondali prevalentemente rocciosi e coralligeni. Il calcolo della media pesata (per esemplari) delle dimensioni massime delle specie in collezione è di circa 18,5 millimetri. La ricerca sui pattern cromatici dimostra che la maggior parte degli esemplari presenta un pattern cromatico prevalente rosso o rosa (circa il 55,5\%). In conclusione si ritiene che i reperti in collezione siano stati raccolti da H. sapiens in prevalenza su spiagge caratterizzate da substrato prevalentemente roccioso e/o detritico dalle aree del litorale tirrenico o croate ad uso ornamentale. Si ritiene che questo lavoro possa rappresentare un contributo alla conoscenza delle prime società di H. sapiens.},

	abstract = {This thesis focuses on the description of a fossil shark found in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Pavia during a complex restoration project started in 1989. The specimen represents one of the rarest shark taxa from the world–renown Eocene Bolca locality. Unlike the Ypresian taxa Galeorhinus cuvieri and Eogaleus bolcensis, the specimen partly disarticulated and lies in a limestone matrix, suggesting its provenience from the Monte Postale site. The dataset of measurements for body parameters, vertebral centra, teeth and placoid scales was compared to both fossil and extant taxa in order to discuss the overall systematic assessments of the Bolca sharks at higher taxonomic levels. Overall body measurements collected from all Bolca specimens were combine in order to estimate the size of the examined specimen. Statistical approach performed on body measurements and preserved vertebrae support a largely sharing of these characters among the extant taxa of the order Carcharhiniformes. SEM analysis on dermal denticle support that the Pavia specimen is an individual of Eogaleus bolcensis. A comprehensive dataset of teeth was used to compare dental morphologies of the living species Galeorhinus galeus and Galeocerdo cuvier, considered here as standards. The general clustering is primarily based on qualitative characters and ratios between selected measurements. The comparison between fossil and extant taxa based on newly defined tooth morphotypes increase our knowledge on taxonomic identifications of Bolca’s sharks. The morphometrical measurements for each fossil specimen indicates three distinct ontogenetic classes, further supported by estimated ages following standard Von Bertalanffy growth curves. As the present–day Galeocerdo, Eogaleus was most likely a mesopelagic, top predator. The combination of biological and abiotic proxies suggests the Bolca setting as a possible nursery area for the juvenile–schooling individuals of G. cuvieri.},

	abstract = {This thesis has the main aim of defining the lithostratigraphy, depositional architecture, post-depositional modifications and reservoir characteristics of the Cardium Formation in the Ferrier Oilfield, and how these characteristics can have great impact over production rates, GOR and produced fluid discrimination.  In the Ferrier area, the Cardium Formation is composed by a NE prograding clastic sequence made up of offshore to shoreface deposits sealed by marine shales.  The main reservoir is composed by sandstones and conglomerates interpreted to have deposited in a shoreface depositional environment.  Lithofacies and net reservoir thickness mapping led to more detailed understanding of the 3D reservoir architecture, and cross-sections shed light on the Cardium depositional architecture and post-deposition sediment erosion in the Ferrier area.  Detailed core logging, thin section, SEM and CL analyses were used to study the mineralogy, texture and pore characterization of the Cardium reservoir, and three main compartments have been identified based on production data and reservoir characteristics.  Finally, two situations showing odd production behaviour of the Cardium were resolved. This shed light on the effect of structural features and reservoir quality and thickness over hydrocarbon migration pathways.  The Ferrier example offers a unique case of fluid discrimination in clastic reservoirs due both to depositional and post-depositional factors, and could be used as analogue for similar situations in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.},

	abstract = {Nel presente lavoro sono state analizzate le distribuzioni quantitative dei Foraminiferi planctonici e bentonici presenti in una carota e in un box core prelevati nel Mare di Ross in Antartide durante la campagna KOPRI ANTA03 nel Febbraio 2013 nell’ambito del progetto di ricerca congiunto Corea- Italia finanziato dal Progetto Nazionale di Ricerca in Antartide (PNRA). Scopo del lavoro è stato quello di comprendere l’evoluzione ambientale dell’area in base alla distribuzione quantitativa e qualitativa delle associazioni a Foraminiferi nel tardo Quaternario.  In base alla distribuzione quantitativa dei Foraminiferi identificati, la sequenza sedimentaria della carota C2 è stata suddivisa in tre intervalli corrispondenti a tre principali fasi paleoceanografiche/paleoclimatiche. La prima fase, più antica di 18 ka, caratterizzata dall’assenza o rarità di forme documenta un ambiente con presenza di copertura glaciale. La seconda, depositatasi tra 18 ka e {\textasciitilde}8 ka è caratterizzata da una maggiore variabilità intraspecifica e riflette un miglioramento delle condizioni climatiche. La terza, corrisponde ad un periodo compreso tra {\textasciitilde}8 ka e {\textasciitilde}2 ka. La presenza di forme agglutinanti e l’assenza di Foraminiferi a guscio calcareo suggeriscono la presenza di condizioni di dissoluzione carbonatica sul fondale in un ambiente marino libero da copertura glaciale. La documentazione di numerosi individui allo stadio giovanile di Neogloboquadrina pachyderma durante l’intervallo B ha reso possibile avanzare ipotesi riguardo la strategia di sopravvivenza di questa specie in ambiente estremo quale il ghiaccio antartico. La somiglianza morfologica tra individui giovanili di Neogloboquadrina pachyderma riscontrata durante il nostro studio nei sedimenti a livello fossile nella carota con individui giovanili della stessa specie provenienti da campioni di ghiaccio marino antartico documentati in bibliografia, ha permesso di supportare la tesi dello sviluppo di tali forme nei pori del “microghiaccio”.},

Tramite i dati forniti da strumenti geofisici, quali l’ecoscandaglio a fascio multiplo (Multibeam) e i profili sismici Chirp Sub-bottom, è stato possibile lo studio di tali elementi e la redazione di due mappe che riportano le isobate delle profondità della superficie di massima ingressione marina e degli isospessori del cuneo olocenico di stazionamento alto. I depositi, nel corso del lavoro, sono stati suddivisi per facilitare la loro descrizione. L'analisi dei depositi trasgressivi ha permesso il riconoscimento di elementi morfologici quali frecce litorali (spit), isole barriera (barrier island), sistemi barriera-laguna e un sistema deltizio sommerso. Queste elementi sono stati ricondotti dunque ad una piattaforma relitta, ormai sommersa, le cui morfologie sono state plasmate dall'ultima trasgressione marina. Grazie ai profili chirp subbottom è stato inoltre possibile riconoscere un basamento carbonatico Meso-Cenozoico con un area di 23 km². I depositi olocenici di stazionamento alto occupano circa l'88\% della superficie della piattaforma analizzata. Gli spessori maggiori, corrispondenti a 25m, sono stati riscontrati in prossimità della costa da cui degradano verso nord fino ad estinguersi. L'estensione del cuneo olocenico risulta essere influenzata dalle correnti, che trasportano i sedimenti verso est, dalla presenza degli alti morfologici, in prossimità della cui superficie i sedimenti si arrestano, e dall'apporto fluviale fornito dalle fiumare che sfociano nella zona analizzata.  Quest'ultimo è il fattore che influenza maggiormente lo spessore del cuneo. Nelle aree di piattaforma prossime alle foci fluviali inoltre è stata riscontrata la deposizione di materiali grossolani che lateralmente sfumano a fini attraverso contatti eteropici.},

L'origine di queste mineralizzazioni va ricercato nello stadio idrotermale del processo di raffreddamento del magma e nel caso della zona di studio più precisamente va ricondotto al raffreddamento del Plutone di Porto Azzurro. L’obiettivo di questa tesi, quindi, è quello di tentare di formulare almeno due modelli concettuali, i quali siano in grado di spiegare come si sono formate parte delle suddette mineralizzazioni di natura idrotermale e, al tempo stesso, comprendere meglio quali processi fisici, chimici e geologici sono entrati in gioco. Infine, le osservazioni puntuali all’affioramento ed al microscopio su campioni chiave raccolti nella zona studiata sono utilizzate per discriminare le fasi deformative collegate ai fluidi, ordinare cronologicamente le fasi deformative avvenute e, quindi, cercare di inquadrare la faglia Topinetti nel contesto evolutivo geodinamico degli Appennini settentrionali.},

Oltre a uno studio di carattere strutturale mirato a chiarire l’eventuale controllo esercitato dalla storia deformativa locale sulla cristallizzazione del quarzo, si è deciso altresì di studiare le inclusioni fluide presenti in alcuni cristalli. Il rilevamento di terreno presso Case Calistri (BO) ha permesso l’individuazione di una correlazione fra la direzione delle fratture e la mineralizzazione. Lo studio delle inclusioni fluide ha permesso invece di stimare la temperatura di intrappolamento delle inclusioni. Infine è stata ricostruita una storia deformativa locale che prevede due eventi distinti, un primo evento trascorrente seguito da uno estensionale, seguiti dalla circolazione di almeno due generazioni di fluidi.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to develop 3D geological models employ a mix of quantitative and qualitative scientiﬁc techniques, which do not fully provide quantiﬁcation of uncertainty in the constructed models and fail to optimally weight geological ﬁeld observations against constraints from geophysical data. Here, using the Bayesian Obsidian software package, we develop a methodology to fuse lithostratigraphic ﬁeld observations with aeromagnetic and gravity data to build a 3D model in a small (13.5 km Â 13.5 km) region of the Gascoyne Province, Western Australia. Our approach is validated by comparing 3D model results to independently-constrained geological maps and cross-sections produced by the Geological Survey of Western Australia. By fusing geological ﬁeld data with aeromagnetic and gravity surveys, we show that 89\% of the modelled region has {\textgreater}95\% certainty for a particular geological unit for the given model and data. The boundaries between geological units are characterized by narrow regions with {\textless}95\% certainty, which are typically 400–1000 m wide at the Earth’s surface and 500–2000 m wide at depth. Beyond {\textasciitilde}4 km depth, the model requires geophysical survey data with longer wavelengths (e.g., active seismic) to constrain the deeper subsurface. Although Obsidian was originally built for sedimentary basin problems, there is reasonable applicability to deformed terranes such as the Gascoyne Province. Ultimately, modiﬁcation of the Bayesian engine to incorporate structural data will aid in developing more robust 3D models. Nevertheless, our results show that surface geological observations fused with geophysical survey data can yield reasonable 3D geological models with narrow uncertainty regions at the surface and shallow subsurface, which will be especially valuable for mineral exploration and the development of 3D geological models under cover.},

These models encouragedpeople to engage in investments that turned out to be far riskier than the models predicted.These models were created by some of the brightest PhD’s from the best universities, butthey failed miserably because they modeled everyday events very well, but modeled the rareevents and the interconnection of events poorly. They failed badly by not understandingtheir application, and in particular, by trying to extrapolate typical behavior when theirprimary goal was to protect against highly atypical situations. The moral of the fable isthat brilliant analysis is not helpful when the modeling is poor; as computer engineers say,“garbage in, garbage out.”},

However, the Koschmieder model is not applicable for viewable distances of hundreds of meters when the angular dimension of an object is signiﬁcantly greater than the eye resolution of the human being. The authors further separate the term ‘‘visible’’ into ‘‘simple detection’’ or ‘‘detectability’’ and ‘‘clear identiﬁcation’’ or ‘‘identiﬁability’’ and point out that the Koschmieder model is applicable to identiﬁability, but not necessarily for detectability. In addition, the way of calculating contrast is revised to follow the concept of brightness constancy. The results of this effort advocate the measurement and distribution of detectability in harsh weather conditions, as such data offer more useful and important information for daily life.},

	abstract = {A typical geostatistical analysis of soil data proceeds on the assumption that the properties of interest are the outcomes of random processes. Is the assumption reasonable? Many factors have contributed to the soil as we see it, both in the parent material and during its formation. Each has a physical cause, each must obey the laws of physics, and each is in principle deterministic except at the sub-atomic level. The outcome must therefore be deterministic. Yet such is the complexity of the factors in combination, their variation over the time, and the incompleteness of our knowledge, that the outcome, the soil, appears to us as if it were random. Only when we see the results of man’s activities, such as the division of the land into fields, the imposition of irrigation, and ditches for drainage, do we recognize organized control. Clearly, the soil is not random, but except in the latter instances we are unlikely to go far wrong if we assume that it is. A second assumption underlying many geostatistical analyses is that of stationarity. We might ask if this holds. In the real world, we have ever only one realization of the random process in a particular region, and so the question has no answer. We can look to see whether regional averages are the same when we move from region to region. This means treating data from different regions as if they were different realizations of the same generating process. We should therefore change our question to ‘is a stationary model of the soil realistic?’ We can then examine the reality against the assumptions of our model. The soil is neither random nor stationary, but our models of it may be one or other or both. We should therefore ask whether our models are reasonable in the circumstances and whether they are profitable in leading to accurate predictions. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We show how distributions over this class of ‘deformed’ tessellations can be used to define prior distributions for models based on tessellations, and how inference for such models can be carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods; stability properties of the algorithms are investigated. Our approach applies not only to fixed dimension problems, but also to variable dimension problems, in which the number of cells in the tessellation is unknown. We illustrate our methods with two real examples. The first relates to reconstructing animal territories, represented by the individual cells of a tessellation, from observation of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. The second example involves the analysis of an image of a cross-section through a sample of metal, with the tessellation modelling the micro-crystalline structure of the metal.},

	abstract = {Components of geostatistical estimation, developed as a method for ore deposit assessment, are discussed in detail. The assumption that spatial observations can be treated as a stochastic process is judged to be an inappropriate model for natural data. Problems of semivariogram formulation are reviewed, and this method is considered to be inadequate for estimating the function being sought. Characteristics of bivariate interpolation are summarized, highlighting kriging limitations as an interpolation method. Limitations are similar to those of inverse distance weighted observations interpolation. Attention is drawn to the local bias of kriging and misplaced claims that it is an "optimal" interpolation method. The so-called "estimation variance, " interpreted as providing confidence limits for estimation of mining blocks, is shown to be meaningless as an index of local variation. The claim that geostatistics constitutes a "new science" is examined in detail. Such novelties as exist in the method are shown to transgress accepted principles of scientific inference. Stochastic modeling in general is discussed, and purposes of the approach emphasized. For the purpose of detailed quantitative assessment it can provide only prediction qualified by hypothesis at best. Such an approach should play no part in ore deposit assessment where the need is for local detailed inventories; these can only be achieved properly through local deterministic methods, where prediction is purely deductive.},

	abstract = {Abundant literature has been produced for the last two decades about multiple-point statistics simulation, or MPS. The idea behind MPS is very simple: reproduce patterns from a 2D, or most often a 3D, training image that displays the type of geological heterogeneity deemed to be relevant to the reservoir or ﬁeld under study, while honoring local data. Replicating an image is a traditional computer science problem. Thus, it should come as no surprise if a growing number of publications on MPS borrow ideas and techniques directly from computer vision and machine learning to improve the reproduction of training patterns. However, quoting Andre Journel, “Geostatistics is not about generating pretty pictures.” Models have a purpose. For example, in oil and gas applications, reservoir models are used to estimate hydrocarbon volumes and book reserves, run ﬂow simulations to forecast hydrocarbon production and ultimate recovery, and make decisions about ﬁeld development or optimal well drilling locations. Speciﬁc key features such as the extent and connectivity of shale barriers may have a major impact on the reservoir performance forecasts and the ﬁeld development decisions to be made. Those key features that need to be captured in the model, along with the available subsurface data and constraints of the project, should be the primary drivers in selecting the most appropriate modeling techniques and options to obtain reliable results and make sound decisions. In this paper, the practitioners’ point of view is used to evaluate alternative MPS implementations and highlight remaining gaps.},

Several target areas were chosen at selected locations around the spacecraft, and photometric measurements were taken with the television camera throughout the lunar day. Surveyor I data agree within ±20\% with the terrestrially observed photometric properties. Initial examination of the data indicates no anomalies of the photometric properties of homogeneous areas on scales greater than 6 cm in diameter. Luminance factors were estimated from the observed data and ranged from 7.0\% to 7.5\% for more than 91\% of the area; however, values of 5\% to 25\% were recorded in some locations. The chromaticity coordinates of the disturbed area near one of the footpads were found to be very close to natural sunlight on a gray paint. A preliminary estimate of the spectral radiance factor of this area is given, using an eigenvector-analysis technique. The spacecraft characteristics, viewing geometry, and ground-recording techniques are included, along with a brief description of errors.},

We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The ®rst concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Paci®c island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process Sx, observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of Sxi  appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of Sx, making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

This work aims to identify operational parameters specifically conceived for the classification of marble tiles. In this specific case the meaningful aesthetical properties are mainly linked to the anisotropy of the RGB intensities and, specifically, to the “veins”. Starting from the classical geostatistical and morphological modelling (variograms, granulometries, etc.), specific operational parameters have been obtained for a quantitative measurement of veins density, colour, and geometrical features (width, shape, continuity, etc.). The actual methodology defines commercial categories on the base of a self-appraisal process, which identifies intervals of several parameters. The current procedure is too rigid and doesn’t allow choosing in an intuitive way the discriminating properties. The proposed approach identifies understandable characteristics (vein features), and proposes quantitative indexes which actually satisfy the commercial classification of marbles.},

In the 1950s, charts of typical sphericity and roundness values were developed to alleviate tedious manual determination. They allowed users to classify particles by visual comparison to typical particles possessing ranges of sphericity and roundness. The original definitions and somewhat subjective chart methods are still widely used today. This paper describes robust numerical methods based on computational geometry to determine precisely the traditional values from two-dimensional images of particles. Statistical methods including locally weighted regression and K-fold cross-validation were used to discretise a mean particle surface and thereby quantify and remove roughness. The paper details the algorithms for identifying particle corners and fitting circles to them for computation of roundness. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the most appropriate definition for particle sphericity from among five that are commonly cited. Finally, recommendations are made for the minimum image resolutions and particle perimeter discretisation necessary to obtain accurate results.},

Although the benefits of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the field closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract = {This study is a ﬁrst survey of the occurrence of artiﬁcial (137Cs, 241Am, 207Bi, Pu isotopes) and natural (210Pb, 228Ac, 214Bi, 40K) radionuclides in Norwegian cryoconite. Cryoconite samples were collected before (12 samples) and after (5 samples) a rainfall event, after which 7 cryoconite holes dissapeared. The concentrations of radionuclides in cryoconite samples from the Blåisen Glacier are compared with data from the Arctic and Alpine glaciers. Cryoconite samples from the studied glacier had extremely high activity concentrations of 137Cs, 241Am, 207Bi and 239+240Pu (up to 25,000 Bq/kg, 58 Bq/kg, 13 Bq/kg and 131 Bq/kg, respectively) and also high concentrations of organic matter (OM), comparing to other Scandinavian and Arctic glaciers, reaching up to {\textasciitilde}40\% of total mass. The outstandingly high concentrations of 137Cs, 241Am, Pu isotopes, and 207Bi on the Blåisen Glacier are primarily related to bioaccumulation of radionuclides in organic-rich cryoconite and might be enhanced by additional transfers of contamination from the tundra by lemmings during their population peaks. The presumed inﬂuence of intense rainfall on radionuclide concentrations in the cryoconite was not conﬁrmed.},

	abstract = {Progress in the foundations of mathematics has made it possible to formulate all thinkable mathematical concepts, algorithms and proofs in one language and in an impeccable way. This is not in spite of, but partially based on the famous results of Gödel and Turing. In this way statements are about mathematical objects
              and
              algorithms, proofs show the correctness of statements
              and
              computations, and computations are dealing with objects
              and
              proofs. Interactive computer systems for a full integration of defining, computing and proving are based on this. The human defines concepts, constructs algorithms and provides proofs, while the machine checks that the definitions are well formed and the proofs and computations are correct. Results formalized so far demonstrate the feasibility of this ‘computer mathematics’. Also there are very good applications. The challenge is to make the systems more mathematician-friendly, by building libraries and tools. The eventual goal is to help humans to learn, develop, communicate, referee and apply mathematics.},

Yet, how these traits respond to emerging threats like infectious disease remains underexplored. Infectious pneumonia threatens bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations across North America and we hypothesized it may also reduce horn growth in male sheep. We assess the effect of pneumonia on horn size in male bighorn sheep using 12 herd datasets from across the western United States that had horn growth and disease data. Disease resulted in 12–35\% reduction in increment (yearly) length and 3–13\% reduction in total horn length in exposed individuals. The disease effect was prolonged when pathogens continued to circulate in sheep populations. Further, disease likely delays the age at which horns reach ¾‐curl and prevents achievement of full‐curl. This is further evidenced with 6 of the 12 herds experiencing an increase in average age at harvest following die‐off events.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of tectonics on surface processes and the resultant stratigraphic evolution in multi-phase rifts is challenging, as patterns of erosion and deposition related to older phases of extension are overprinted by the subsequent extensional phases. In this study, we use a one-way coupled numerical modelling approach between a tectonic and a surface processes model to investigate topographic evolution, erosion and basin stratigraphy during single and multi-phase rifting. We compare the results from the single and the multi-phase rift experiments for a 5 Myr period during which they experience equal amounts of extension, but with the multi-phase experiment experiencing fault topography inherited from a previous phase of extension. Our results demonstrate a very dynamic evolution of the drainage network that occurs in response to fault growth and linkage and to depocentre overfilling and overspilling. We observe profound differences between topographic and depocenter development during single and multi-phase rifting with implications for sedimentary facies architecture. Our quantitative approach, enables us to better understand the impact of changing extension direction on the distribution of sediment source areas and the syn-rift stratigraphic development through time and space.},

	abstract = {Ignimbrites within calderas host intrusions with hazardous and/or economically signiﬁcant hydrothermal systems. The Hvítserkur ignimbrite at Breiðavík caldera, north-eastern Iceland, is intruded by basaltic dykes. The country rock ignimbrite is generally soft and zeolite-rich, has low permeability, high porosity, and few macrofractures. However, the ignimbrite immediately adjacent to the dyke is hard, recrystallised quartz, plagioclase, and alkali feldspar, with a low permeability and porosity and frequent macrofractures. At 1–2 m from the dyke, the ignimbrite is hard, dominantly glassy with pervasive perlitic microfractures, has high permeability, but low porosity and frequent macrofractures. A narrow zone of pervasive unlithiﬁed clay exists 2 m from the dyke. The dyke intrusion promoted a narrow zone of welding, fracturing, and perlitisation in the ignimbrite resulting in high permeability and focussed alteration. Our study shows how intrusions and their thermal aureoles create vertical pathways for, and horizontal barriers to, geothermal ﬂuid ﬂow.},

However, despite this being a frequently encountered situation in emergency departments, there is no comprehensive algorithm to manage and follow these patients in the current literature. The purposes of this study were to describe the most commonly used ring removal techniques and to establish an algorithm for the removal of rings trapped on ﬁngers. We performed a comprehensive literature search in several databases to identify all articles, case reports, letters, and book chapters that focus on ring removal techniques in English language from 1960 to the present. There are 2 methods of removal: (1) noncutting techniques in which the rings can be removed without breaking the integrity of the ring and (2) various ring-cutting equipments and tools. All these techniques are classiﬁed into distinct groups and described in detail with illustrations. Furthermore, an algorithm for handling such patients is established according to case-based patient care. Following an algorithm for the removal of trapped rings on the ﬁnger will be useful for patients and emergency physicians. It will also prevent possible complications and will save time.},

	abstract = {Geodynamic modelling provides a powerful tool to investigate processes in the Earth’s crust, mantle, and core that are not directly observable. However, numerical models are inherently subject to the assumptions and simpliﬁcations on which they are based. In order to use and review numerical modelling studies appropriately, one needs to be aware of the limitations of geodynamic modelling as well as its advantages. Here, we present a comprehensive, yet concise overview of 5 the geodynamic modelling process applied to the solid Earth, from the choice of governing equations to numerical methods, model setup, model interpretation, and the eventual communication of the model results. We highlight best practices and discuss their implementations including code veriﬁcation, model validation, internal consistency checks, and software and data management. Thus, with this perspective, we encourage high-quality modelling studies, fair external interpretation, and sensible use of published work. We provide ample examples from lithosphere and mantle dynamics and point out synergies 10 with related ﬁelds such as seismology, tectonophysics, geology, mineral physics, and geodesy. We clarify and consolidate terminology across geodynamics and numerical modelling to set a standard for clear communication of modelling studies. All in all, this paper presents the basics of geodynamic modelling for ﬁrst-time and experienced modellers, collaborators, and reviewers from diverse backgrounds to (re)gain a solid understanding of geodynamic modelling as a whole.},

Both tests were detected by the global seismic network of the Comprehensive nuclear Test-Ban-Treaty Organisation. We apply a correlation detector using a 10-s signal template from the 2006 test on the MJAR array in Japan to: 1) assess the potential for automatically detecting subsequent explosions at or near the test site; and 2) monitor the associated false alarm rate. The 2009 signal is detected clearly with no false alarms in a three-year period. By detecting scaled-down copies of the explosion signals submerged into background noise, we argue that a signiﬁcantly smaller explosion at the site would have been detected automatically, with a low false alarm rate. The performance of the correlator on MJAR is not diminished by the signal incoherence that makes conventional array processing problematic at this array. We demonstrate that false alarm elimination by f-k analysis of single channel detection statistic traces is crucial for maintaining a low detection threshold. Correlation detectors are to be advocated as a routine complement to the existing pipeline detectors, both for reducing the detection threshold for sites of interest and providing automatic classiﬁcation of signals from repeating sources.},

We assume that this artefact consists of ‘‘smooth’’ variations of the intensity of the signal of interest R. Such an assumption is classically modelled using a function L which acts in a multiplicative way on R. Our goal is to estimate R from observations of a random variable Y which obeys the regression model Y = RL + ε. Our main contribution lies in the derivation of a new estimator of R which is shown to be consistent under suitable identifiability and regularity conditions. The accuracy of this new estimation procedure is studied from a theoretical point of view through the rate of convergence of the uniform risk. Applications to real Scanning Electron Microscopy images are presented, as well as a qualitative study of the performances of our method with respect to other image processing techniques.},

              Small inclusions in diamonds brought up from the mantle provide valuable clues to the mineralogy and chemistry of parts of Earth that we cannot otherwise sample. Tschauner
              et al.
              found inclusions of the high-pressure form of water called ice-VII in diamonds sourced from between 410 and 660 km depth, the part of the mantle known as the transition zone. The transition zone is a region where the stable minerals have high water storage capacity. The inclusions suggest that local aqueous pockets form at the transition zone boundary owing to the release of chemically bound water as rock cycles in and out of this region.

            The presence of ice-VII in diamond inclusions requires regions of the mantle with a free aqueous phase.
          , 
            Water-rich regions in Earth’s deeper mantle are suspected to play a key role in the global water budget and the mobility of heat-generating elements. We show that ice-VII occurs as inclusions in natural diamond and serves as an indicator for such water-rich regions. Ice-VII, the residue of aqueous fluid present during growth of diamond, crystallizes upon ascent of the host diamonds but remains at pressures as high as 24 gigapascals; it is now recognized as a mineral by the International Mineralogical Association. In particular, ice-VII in diamonds points toward fluid-rich locations in the upper transition zone and around the 660-kilometer boundary.},

The aim of GemGIS, as indicated by the name, is to become a bridge between conventional geoinformation systems (GIS) such as ArcGIS and QGIS, and currently open-source geomodelling tools such as GemPy, enabling simpler and more automated workflows from one software environment to the other. Next to the Github-hosted open-source repository, the package concludes a dedicated documentation page containing detailed installation instructions, tutorials for beginners and more advanced users and sample models to walk users through the entire workflow from creating the data to processing the data and to construct a structural geological model. These examples include the well-known Bennison maps for geological mapping. Functionality for visualizing 3D models is available through the PyVista package and through Blender in the near future.},

There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described. Our exposition is catered to those who seek a thorough and uniﬁed reference on the whole subject; detailed derivations of some results are not presented.},

Unit quaternions also have severalother notable advantages that will be discussed in Sec. 6.The main disadvantage of unit quaternions, however, isthat they are constrained to have unit length, a constraint,that while inconsequential in many cases, can lead to com-plications when attempting to optimize over the quater-nion parameters. This is due to the fact that a unity normconstraint is quadratic in form and thus impossible to in-clude in most standard optimization techniques

	abstract = {The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and ocean sciences. As a cross‐platform tool producing high‐quality maps and ﬁgures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations. Plain Language Summary The Generic Mapping Tools software is widely used in Earth and ocean sciences to process data and make maps and illustrations. This new version simpliﬁes usage, adds quick access to key data sets, and provides a tool for making scientiﬁc animations.},

Unlike resinous conifers that can quickly compartmentalize wounds, less decay-resistant angiosperms may face more pronounced risk of injury from coring. To test if coring increases mortality rates in temperate hardwood trees, we leverage a unique dataset tracking the mortality of cored and uncored hardwood trees representing 19 species from 10 genera in a 26-ha plot in Virginia, USA. We compare mortality rates between 935 cored trees and 8605 uncored trees for seven years following coring. Annual mortality rates did not differ between cored trees (1.71\% yr−1; 95\% CI 1.40 to 2.20) and uncored trees (1.85\% yr−1; 95\% CI 1.70 to 2.28) across the full dataset, nor were there differences by genus or size class. These results indicate that the risk of hardwood mortality caused by increment coring is probably lower than previously assumed. However, these results cannot rule out the possibility that coring elevates hardwood mortality in other climates or when trees face multiple additional stressors that were not influential over the course of our study.},

	title = {Morfologia e potenziale di contatto dell'interfaccia metallo/organico},
	url = {http://amslaurea.unibo.it/15799/},
	abstract = {In questo lavoro di tesi si propone lo studio morfologico e del potenziale di contatto di un'interfaccia modello metallo/organico. Nello specifico si � analizzata l'interfaccia oro/sexitiofene composta da uno strato ultrasottile di oro (circa 0.3 nm) depositato su uno strato monomolecolare di sexitiofene (6T). Le molecole sono state depositate via Molecolar Beam Epitaxy (MBE) su un substrato conduttivo di indio stagno (ITO) con bassa rugosit� superficiale (circa  4 �). Nell?ambito di questo lavoro si � sviluppata anche una tecnica che permette di controllare il meccanismo di crescita del 6T ed ottenere uno strato monomolecolare che ricopre omogeneamente la superficie (ricopertura superficiale circa del 97\%).  L?oro � stato depositato sullo strato organico via Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).  

Le tecniche di microscopia utilizzate sono l'Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) e la Kelvin Probe Microscopy (KPM), rispettivamente per la misura della topografia e del potenziale di contatto. Dalle osservazioni sperimentali si deduce che la deposizione dell?oro non danneggia e non penetra lo strato di organico. Inaspettatamente � stato osservato un fenomeno di riorganizzazione superficiale dello strato di oro (de-wetting), attribuito a fenomeni legati all?energia superficiale delle interfacce.  La riorganizzazione � tale da trasformare lo strato d?oro depositato sotto forma di un film continuo in un film granulare, composto da grani d?oro di raggio compreso nell?intervallo [8 ? 10] nm. Il fenomeno di de-wetting dipende criticamente dallo spessore del film, nel nostro caso ultra-sottile e avviene in modo simile, ma non identico, sia sull?ITO sia sul 6T.  L'analisi del potenziale di contatto ha mostrato le stesse relazioni di disuguaglianza attese dai valori riportati in letteratura. Fra i grani sopra il 6T e sopra l?ITO si osserva un contrasto nel potenziale di contatto, attribuito a una convoluzione laterale delle funzioni lavoro dei materiali.},

	title = {Studio della correlazione tra il drogaggio del silicio e l'energia superficiale del suo ossido nativo},
	url = {http://amslaurea.unibo.it/9413/},
	abstract = {In questo lavoro di tesi abbiamo studiato la relazione esistente tra la concentrazione di drogante in un wafer di silicio e l?energia superficiale del suo ossido nativo. La strumentazione utilizzata per la misura dell?energia superficiale è il tensiometro ottico, uno strumento semplice ma efficace per valutare le proprietà chimico-fisiche dell?interfaccia liquido-solido. Il tensiometro ottico misura l?angolo di contatto statico e dinamico. La misura dell?angolo statico ci ha permesso di valutare l?energia superficiale dell?ossido nativo attraverso il metodo di Owen-Wendt. Per valutare l?omogeneità chimica/fisica dell?ossido abbiamo invece misurato l?isteresi dell?angolo di contatto in configurazione dinamica. Le misure di angolo statico e dinamico sono state realizzate su 10 frammenti di wafer di silicio a concentrazione crescente da 10{\textasciicircum} 13 a 10{\textasciicircum} 19 atomi/cm{\textasciicircum} 3 di entrambi i tipi di drogante (ossia di tipo p - boro - e di tipo n - fosforo -). E? stato osservato che, per i substrati drogati con boro, l?energia superficiale presenta un picco corrispondente ad una concentrazione di circa 10{\textasciicircum} 15 atomi/cm{\textasciicircum} 3 nell?intervallo di concentrazione 2 ? 10{\textasciicircum} 13 ? 1.6 ? 10{\textasciicircum} 16 atomi/cm{\textasciicircum} 3. Mentre i campioni drogati con fosforo presentano un andamento dell?energia superficiale leggermente crescente al crescere della concentrazione di drogaggio nell?intervallo di concentrazione 6.5 ? 10{\textasciicircum} 14 ? 1.5 ? 10{\textasciicircum} 19 atomi/cm{\textasciicircum} 3. Questo risultato è stato correlato alla diffusione degli atomi di drogante nell?ossido che raggiunge l?interfaccia SiO2 ? Aria. L?osservazione sperimentale che l?energia superficiale dell?ossido dipenda dalla concentrazione di drogante è avvalorata dal confronto fra la componente polare e dispersiva, in particolare la componente polare presenta lo stesso picco osservato nell?energia superficiale. Le impurità nell?ossido, determinate dagli atomi di drogante, conferiscono quindi polarità alla superficie aumentando l?energia superficiale totale. Dal confronto fra le misure dei campioni as received con le misure dell?ossido ricostruito dopo 7 e 21 giorni di esposizione all?aria, ricaviamo che gli atomi di drogante diffondono nel tempo e, in particolare, la polarità superficiale ritorna alle con- dizioni as recived dopo 21 giorni dalla rimozione dell?ossido. E? stata simulata numericamente una goccia su una superficie, comprendendo come il picco osservato nell?energia superficiale corrisponde ad un minimo dell?energia di Gibbs per i campioni di tipo p. Infine, l?isteresi aumenta in valor medio per i campioni con ossido ricostruito rispetto ai campioni as recived, ad indicare una possibile variazione dell?omogeneità chimico-fisica delle superfici.},

	abstract = {The last two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain datasets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of ﬂexibility, mathematical simplicity and comparative robustness, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such datasets. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and ﬂexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

Here, we present a probabilistic prediction of 21st century mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet calibrated with observations of surface speeds and mass change using a novel two-stage surrogate-based approach. Our results suggest a sea-level contribution ranging from 4 to 30 cm at the year 2100, proviso the assumption that our chosen ice sheet model’s physics represent reality.},

In four examples from the gerontology literature, we illustrate different ways to specify alternative models that can be used to reject the presence of a meaningful or predicted effect in hypothesis tests. We provide detailed explanations of how to calculate, report, and interpret Bayes factors and equivalence tests. We also discuss how to design informative studies that can provide support for a null model or for the absence of a meaningful effect. The conceptual differences between Bayes factors and equivalence tests are discussed, and we also note when and why they might lead to similar or different inferences in practice. It is important that researchers are able to falsify predictions or can quantify the support for predicted null effects.

The images must experience extraordinary optical deformations due to the deflection of light rays produced by the strong curvature of the space-time in the vicinity. General relativity allows the calculation of such effects, both on a surrounding accretion disk and on the background star field.

The lead initial investigator of the find argued that it was unique, preserved by serendipitous circumstances. It was hypothesised that the mummy with associated artefacts had been quickly covered by glacier ice and stayed buried until the melt-out in 1991. It is now more than 30 years since Ötzi appeared. In this paper, we take a closer look at how the find can be understood today, benefitting from increased knowledge gained from more than two decades of investigations of other glacial archaeological sites, and from previous palaeo-biological investigations of the find assemblage. In the light of radiocarbon dates from the gully and new glaciological evidence regarding mass balance, it is likely that Ötzi was not permanently buried in ice immediately after his death, but that the gully where he lay was repeatedly exposed over the next 1500 years. We discuss the nature of the ice covering the site, which is commonly described as a basally sliding glacier. Based on the available evidence, this ice is better understood as a non-moving, stationary field of snow and ice, frozen to the bedrock. The damaged artefacts found with Ötzi were probably broken by typical postdepositional processes on glacial archaeological sites, and not, as previously claimed, during conflict prior to Ötzi’s flight from the valley below.},

            A common challenge in acoustic meteoroid signal analyses is to discriminate whether the observed wavefield can be better described by line-source or point-source models. This challenge typically arises from a sparse availability of observations. In this work, we present an outstanding record of ground-coupled waves from local large-N seismic and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) observations of a meteoroid in Iceland. Our complete data set includes additional regional stations located within 300 km of the meteoroid’s trajectory. The dense large-N and DAS data allow identification of acoustic phases that are almost impossible to discriminate on sparser networks, including a weak late arrival resolved mostly only by DAS. Using this data set with a new Bayesian inversion model, we estimate the trajectory parameters of one fragment from the meteoroid. With these results we investigate its orbit in the solar system and propose a classification of the Icelandic event as a slow meteoroid of asteroidal origin with an energy on the order of 4–40 GJ, a probable size on the order of centimeters, and an orbit range consistent with the main asteroid belt.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We analyze the problem of calculating high-frequency ground motions (\&gt;1 Hz) caused by earthquakes having arbitrary spatial variations of rupture velocity and slip velocity (or stress drop) over the fault. We approximate the elastic wave Green's functions by far-field body waves, which we calculate using geometric ray theory. However, we do not make the traditional Fraunhofer approximation, so our method may be used close to large faults. The method is confined to high frequencies (greater than about 1 Hz) due to the omisson of near-field terms, and must be used at source-observer distances less than a few source depths, due to the omission of surface waves. It is easily used in laterally varying velocity structures. Assuming a simple parameterization of the slip function, the computational problem collapses to the evaluation of a series of line integrals over the fault, with one line integral per each time ti in the observer seismogram. The path of integration corresponding to observation time ti consists of only those points on the fault which radiate body waves arriving at the observer at exactly time ti. This path is an isochron of the arrival time function. An isochron velocity may be defined that depends on rupture velocity and resembles the usual directivity function. Observed ground motions are directly dependent upon this isochron velocity. Ground velocity is proportional to isochron velocity and ground acceleration is proportional to isochron acceleration in dislocation models of rupture. Ground acceleration may also be related to spatial variations of slip velocity on the fault, using the square of isochron velocity as a constant of proportionality. We show two rupture models, one with variable slip velocity and the other with variable rupture velocity, that cause the same ground acceleration at a single observer. The computational method is shown to produce reasonably accurate synthetic seismograms, compared to a method using complete Green's functions, and requires about 0.5 per cent of the computer time. It may be very effective in calculating ground motions in the frequency band 1 to 10 Hz at observers within a few source depths of large earthquakes, where most of the high-frequency motions may be caused by direct P and S waves. We suggest a possible method for inverting ground motions for both slip velocity and rupture velocity over the fault.},

“Le sue derivazioni erano quasi sempre ridotte alla matematica più elementare, ed egli era moto fiero di usare metodi più banali di quelli riportati nei libri di testo più correnti. Però c'era anche la controparte: derivazioni per le quali non aveva {\textless}{\textless}il trucco{\textgreater}{\textgreater} (ad es. il fattore di Thomas) venivano semplicemente omesse. I fattori erano astutamente scelti per «essere di ordine uno», e cose delicate, come la teoria della misura in Meccanica Quantistica, non venivano discusse. Infatti Fermi aveva (forse perché estraneo alla scuola di Copenhagen) un atteggiamento puramente pragmatico verso questa disciplina. «La meccanica quantistica è giusta perché funziona...» e «The Schrödinger equation has no business working so well» sono alcuni dei suoi detti.” (“Il nuovo saggiatore”, 2001, p. 29)
“3) Fermi improvvisò, durante il solito seminario settimanale, una teoria del mescolamento delle acque che ha luogo nel mare. L'unico parametro di questa teoria era la lunghezza delle onde superficiali. Fermi pose 200 m. Un collega obbiettò: «Enrico, non sono piuttosto 600 metri?» Fermi rispose «Forse sì. Ma comunque erano 200 m quando attraversai l'oceano l'ultima volta».” (“Il nuovo saggiatore”, 2001, p. 30)

            Borehole accelerometers are designed to record strong ground movements at depth. They have become an important complement to surface accelerometers for seismic and earthquake engineering applications. Borehole accelerometers present several implementation challenges, including their coupling with the geological environment. One possible coupling solution is the use of small glass beads, which are placed inside the borehole casing with the purpose of filling in any empty space between the sensor and the casing walls. We carried out a test on a shaking table, over a wide range of peak ground accelerations (PGA from 0.17 to 1.64g), allowing the comparison of the signals between a surface accelerometer and a borehole accelerometer coupled through the glass beads. These tests show that there is almost no difference between the surface and borehole accelerometer signals between 0.5 and 25 Hz, and only very small differences outside this band (0.2–0.5 Hz and 25–80 Hz). Furthermore, experience from multiple vertical accelerometric arrays show that an installation using glass beads is “reversible”, that is, 30 yr after the initial installation it can still be possible to easily extract the accelerometers for repair or replacement, without any problems or damage to the sensors.},

            The major eruption that occurred on 15 January 2022 on Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai (HTHH) in Tonga generated powerful acoustic waves that propagated through the atmosphere all over the world. Although the eruption energy was soon estimated from the acoustic waves and the ash cloud, its ranking on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) is still debated. Here, we show the erupted magma volume can be calculated from the significant resonance of the remote seismoacoustic waves recorded in Taiwan. A resonant frequency (f) of ∼0.0117 Hz persisted for \&gt;25 min was clearly recorded by both a dense broadband seismic array and also several infrasonic stations in Taiwan. If the volcanic cavity produced by the erupting magma is considered a classic Helmholtz resonator, then the f constrains the possible volume of the erupted magma to 0.215±0.015  km3. We may conclude that the major eruption on HTHH rated a 4 on the VEI scale. In addition to neutralization between low content of the sulfur dioxide and a huge amount of water, it is potentially too small to cause any significant climate change in 2022.},

Bayesian statistics provides a framework for parameter estimation in which uncertainties about models and measurements are translated into uncertainties in estimates of parameters. This paper provides a simple, step-by-step example—starting from a physical experiment and going through all of the mathematics—to explain the use of Bayesian techniques for estimating the coeﬃcients of gravity and air friction in the equations describing a falling body. In the experiment we dropped an object from a known height and recorded the free fall using a video camera. The video recording was analyzed frame by frame to obtain the distance the body had fallen as a function of time, including measures of uncertainty in our data that we describe as probability densities. We explain the decisions behind the various choices of probability distributions and relate them to observed phenomena. Our measured data are then combined with a mathematical model of a falling body to obtain probability densities on the space of parameters we seek to estimate. We interpret these results and discuss sources of errors in our estimation procedure.},

	abstract = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of Earth’s and planetary surface elevations at larger and ﬁner scales is rapidly progressing through the increasing availability and resolution of digital elevation models (DEMs). Surface elevation observations are being used across an expanding range of ﬁelds to study topographical attributes and their changes over time, notably in glaciology, hydrology, volcanology, seismology, forestry, and geomorphology. However, DEMs frequently contain large-scale instrument noise and varying vertical precision that lead to complex patterns of errors. Here, we present a validated statistical workﬂow to estimate, model, and propagate uncertainties in DEMs. We review the state-of-the-art of DEM accuracy and precision analyses, and deﬁne a conceptual framework to consistently address those. We show how to characterize DEM precision by quantifying the heteroscedasticity of elevation measurements, i.e., varying vertical precision with terrainor sensor-dependent variables, and the spatial correlation of errors that can occur across multiple spatial scales. With the increasing availability of high-precision observations, our workﬂow based on independent elevation data acquired on stable terrain can be applied almost anywhere on Earth. We illustrate how to propagate uncertainties for both pixel-scale and spatial elevation derivatives, using terrain slope and glacier volume changes as examples. We ﬁnd that uncertainties in DEMs are largely underestimated in the literature, and advocate that new metrics of DEM precision are essential to ensure the reliability of future land elevation assessments.},

	abstract = {Physics-based simulations of earthquake ground motion are useful to complement recorded ground motion data. However, the computational expense of realistic numerical simulations complicates their applicability to problems that need real-time solutions (e.g., earthquake early warning) or many solutions for diﬀerent earthquake sources, (e.g., probabilistic seismic hazard assessment). Here, we present a reduced-order model (ROM) that instantaneously generates peak ground velocity (PGV) maps. The predicted ground motions closely approximate high-resolution 3D seismic wave propagation simulation results up to 2 Hz that ordinarily require high-performance computing. We use the interpolated proper orthogonal decomposition technique, a type of surrogate modeling approach. We verify the ROM accuracy using simulations for ﬂat 1D layered and 3D velocity models that include topography. In both cases, the simulated PGV maps exhibit low-rank structure. We quantitatively compare four function approximators to ﬁnd the best-ﬁtting ROMs: radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, multilayer perceptron neural networks, random forests and k-nearest neighbors. We ﬁnd RBFs are the most accurate approximator, resulting in {\textless} 0.1 cm/s average PGV error when applied to an independent testing dataset. We apply the ROMs to predict PGV maps for 1 million diﬀerent focal mechanisms, in which the ROMs identify potentially damaging ground motions that might be overlooked when using only a few physics-based simulations. We also quantify correlations between focal mechanism, depth, and accuracy of the predicted PGV. Overall, the ROM approach demonstrates a new way to obtain physics-informed ground motion estimates on demand.},

Despite that the interplay of layers is of primary concern to a cartographer, much of the research on terrain mapping has focused on studying terrain layers individually. This research aimed to fill this gap by evaluating the effect of combining shaded relief with thematic terrain layers and assessing ratings of beauty, realism, and landform clarity in an exploratory online user study. Specifically, we tested the combination of: manual, multidirectional, and ray-traced shaded relief with three thematic terrain layers: hypsometric tinting, land cover, and orthoimagery. There are five main findings from this exploratory study: (1) there was a direct correlation between beauty and realism scores, (2) the manual relief we tested was consistently rated lowest for beauty, realism, and landform clarity, and orthoimagery was rated the highest for beauty and realism, (3) shaded relief was more influential than thematic terrain layers on landform clarity ratings, (4) participant’s geographic familiarity had a significant impact in four specific instances of the user study, and (5) neither shaded relief or thematic terrain layers were the sole contributors to map reader perceptions of beauty, realism, or landform clarity. We conclude by identifying limitations in our stimuli design and presenting ideas for future research studies on terrain design.},

	doi = {10.1093/comnet/cnz017},
	abstract = {Compared to the heavily studied surface drainage systems, the mountain ridge systems have been a subject of less attention even on the empirical level, despite the fact that their structure is richer. To reduce this deﬁciency, we analyze different mountain ranges by means of a network approach and grasp some essential features of the ridge branching structure. We also employ a fractal analysis as it is especially suitable for describing properties of rough objects and surfaces. As our approach differs from typical analyses that are carried out in geophysics, we believe that it can initialize a research direction that will allow to shed more light on the processes that are responsible for landscape formation and will contribute to the network theory by indicating a need for the construction of new models of the network growth as no existing model can properly describe the ridge formation. We also believe that certain features of our study can offer help in the cartographic generalization. Speciﬁcally, we study structure of the ridge networks based on the empirical elevation data collected by Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. We consider mountain ranges from different geological periods and geographical locations. For each mountain range, we construct a simple “topographic” network representation (i.e., the ridge junctions are nodes) and a “ridge” representation (i.e., the ridges are nodes and the junctions are edges) and calculate the parameters characterizing their topology. We observe that the topographic networks inherit the fractal structure of the mountain ranges but do not show any other complex features. In contrast, the ridge networks, while lacking the proper fractality, reveal the power-law degree distributions with the exponent 1.6 β 1.7. By taking into account the fact that the analyzed mountains differ in many properties, these values seem to be universal for the earthly mountainous terrain.},

	url = {http://amslaurea.unibo.it/27765/},
	abstract = {The increasing number of extreme rainfall events, combined with the high population density and the imperviousness of the land surface, makes urban areas particularly vulnerable to pluvial flooding. In order to design and manage cities to be able to deal with this issue, the reconstruction of weather phenomena is essential. Among the most interesting data sources which show great potential are the observational networks of private sensors managed by citizens (crowdsourcing). The number of these personal weather stations is consistently increasing, and the spatial distribution roughly follows population density. Precisely for this reason, they perfectly suit this detailed study on the modelling of pluvial flood in urban environments. The uncertainty associated with these measurements of precipitation is still a matter of research. In order to characterise the accuracy and precision of the crowdsourced data, we carried out exploratory data analyses. A comparison between Netatmo hourly precipitation amounts and observations of the same quantity from weather stations managed by national weather services is presented. The crowdsourced stations have very good skills in rain detection but tend to underestimate the reference value. In detail, the accuracy and precision of crowd- sourced data change as precipitation increases, improving the spread going to the extreme values. Then, the ability of this kind of observation to improve the prediction of pluvial flooding is tested. To this aim, the simplified raster-based inundation model incorporated in the Saferplaces web platform is used for simulating pluvial flooding. Different precipitation fields have been produced and tested as input in the model. Two different case studies are analysed over the most densely populated Norwegian city: Oslo. The crowdsourced weather station observations, bias-corrected (i.e. increased by 25\%), showed very good skills in detecting flooded areas.},

	abstract = {Earthquake moment tensors and centroid locations in the catalogue of the Global CMT (gCMT) project, formerly the Harvard CMT project, have become an essential resource for studying active global tectonics, used by many solid-Earth researchers. The catalogue’s quality, long duration (1976–present), ease of access and global coverage of earthquakes larger than about Mw 5.5 have transformed our ability to study regional patterns of earthquake locations and focal mechanisms. It also allows researchers to easily identify earthquakes with anomalous mechanisms and depths that stand out from the global or regional patterns, some of which require us to look more closely at accepted interpretations of geodynamics, tectonics or rheology. But, as in all catalogues that are, to some extent and necessarily, produced in a semi-routine fashion, the catalogue may contain anomalies that are in fact errors. Thus, before re-assessing geodynamic, tectonic or rheological understanding on the basis of anomalous earthquake locations or mechanisms in the gCMT catalogue, it is ﬁrst prudent to check those anomalies are real. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that necessity in the eastern Himalayas and SE Tibet, where two earthquakes that would otherwise require a radical revision of current geodynamic understanding are shown, in fact, to have gCMT depths (and, in one case, also focal mechanism) that are incorrect.},

	abstract = {Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

The tunnel served as an entrance to an Austro-Hungarian cableway station excavated in the rocks during the Great War just behind the frontline. A comprehensive geophysical survey, based on seismic and ground-penetrating radar profiling, was then undertaken to map other possible World War I (WWI) remains still embedded in the ice. The ice–rock interface was reconstructed over the entire saddle and in the uppermost portion of the glacier. A prominent linear reflector was surprisingly similar to the common response of buried pipes. The reflector orientation, almost longitudinal to the slope, does not seem to be compatible with a glacial conduit or with other natural features. Numerical simulations of a series of possible targets constrained interpretation to a partly water-filled rounded shape cavity. The presence of a preserved WWI tunnel connecting Mount Vioz and Punta Linke could be considered a realistic hypothesis. The Forni glacier could be still considered polythermal and comprised of cold ice without basal sliding in its top portion.},

During the various studies several numerical models have been proposed to explain the collapse dynamics but a comprehensive and reliable insight into the failure kinematics is still missing. A major step forward in the understanding of the landslide mechanisms is represented by the reconstruction of the geometry of the different geological units within the landslide body and of the associated physical properties. A large scale geophysical experiment based on 2D and 3D seismic and resistivity was undertaken to address the issue. Prior to the main survey electrical resistivity and longitudinal and transversal wave velocity of the lithological units involved in the landslide were measured along the exposure of the rock wall below the village of Casso. The geophysical images of the two landslide lobes showed a very good correlation with the reference section. Particularly a conductive unit located in the bottom part of the stratigraphic sequence resulted an excellent geophysical marker. Some important structural records, recently defined on the sliding surface, were imaged in the geophysical profiles of the western lobe indicating a limited internal deformation along the east-west axis during the slide. In the deeper part of the western lobe the geophysical image appears rather complicated because of the partial overlap of the various lithological units occurred during the slide. In the eastern lobe the geophysical images clearly outlined several detachment planes that disrupt the continuity of the pre-landslide geology. The seismic and the resistivity tomography obtained inverting the data resulted comparable indicating a proper choice of the measuring techniques and of the field parameters.},

	abstract = {Lo sviluppo di nuove tecniche di diagnostica e sempre pi� moderne strumentazioni medicali nell?ambito della tomografia computerizzata a raggi X ha reso quantomai necessario lo studio dettagliato e la calibrazione di sistemi quali fantocci eterogenei sempre pi� fedeli alla rappresentazione dei tessuti umani, utilizzando approcci innovativi per la loro modellizzazione numerica.
Nel seguente lavoro, sono messe in evidenza l?efficacia e l?attendibilit� delle tecniche Monte Carlo applicate allo studio e la calibrazione di un sistema investito da radiazione ionizzante durante una tomografia computerizzata di tipo ?dual-energy?.
Tre modelli vengono costruiti e validati: un fantoccio eterogeneo, costituito da venti inserti cilindrici di materiali di diversa densit� e composizione chimica; un fantoccio omogeneo, fatto interamente di PMMA; ed una camera di ionizzazione in aria.
Dopo aver opportunamente impostato i parametri di input, sono state eseguite due simulazioni: una al livello energetico pi� basso, pari ad 80 kVp ed un?altra ad alta energia, ovvero a 140 kVp.
I risultati numerici ottenuti dalle prove sono stati confrontati con quelli sperimentali, valutando il profilo di dose assorbita e gli spettri energetici.
Questa procedura permette di ottenere maggiori informazioni sulla composizione dei tessuti e di visualizzare dettagli con pi� precisione.
Preme sottolineare l?importanza dei metodi Monte Carlo applicati ad una tecnica come la tomografia computerizzata di tipo ?dual-energy?, in continua evoluzione e che sta assumendo un ruolo fondamentale nella diagnostica per immagini.
La consistenza del modello costruito in questo elaborato suggerisce un ulteriore approfondimento nello studio della tecnologia e dei metodi di supporto ad essa, affinch� possa essere possibile fare concreti passi avanti nel miglioramento dello stato dell?arte.},

	abstract = {An approach that relies on L-moments is used to examine the long-term annual series of precipitation maxima for two storm durations, namely 1 and 24 hours. Data are measured at a widespread network of rain gauges sited in the northern part of Italy. Based on 1951-2019 data on precipitation and several climatical information, the main focus of the study is to explore the statistical characteristics of extreme rainfall and to find statistically significant relationships between these characteristics and local mean annual precipitation (MAP), as well as other local morphological descriptors.
First, this study uses a Weighted Moving Average (WMA) approach to assess the relationships between the statistics of observed rainfall annual maxima for 1 and 24 hours, namely the L-moments of order 1 (l1, arithmetic mean), 2 (l2 or L-Cv, analogous to the variance) and 3 (L-Cs, analogous to the skewness) and the mean annual precipitation (MAP), which is often used as a surrogate of geographical location in the literature.    The l1 and l2 displayed the strongest dependence on MAP. Additionally, the coefficients of variation (L-Cv) showed a minor reduction when the mean annual precipitation was rising, which is more apparent in rainfall that lasts for an hour. Second, a stepwise regression procedure was applied to develop multi-regression models for predicting the considered L moments as a function of local morphological and climatic characteristics. Our study shows that MAP, and minimum distance to the Tyrrhenian coast (MinDistTir), are the most important descriptors, showing a strong correlation with the L-statistics of rainfall extremes.},

	title = {Relazione tra ondate di calore e aumento di particolato atmosferico: uno studio a {Bologna}},
	url = {http://amslaurea.unibo.it/28955/},
	abstract = {Le ondate di calore hanno numerosi effetti negativi non solo sulla salute umana, ma anche sull?economia e l?ecosistema. Le ripercussioni negative non sono unicamente legate alle temperature elevate, ma anche al contemporaneo aumento di concentrazione di inquinanti atmosferici, quali ozono e particolato atmosferico, che si verificano durante tali eventi.
Questa tesi si propone di studiare le cause di aumento di particolato atmosferico osservato durante alcune ondate di calore avvenute nella citt� di Bologna, situata in Pianura Padana, una delle regioni europee maggiormente soggette all?inquinamento atmosferico. A questo scopo, sono state selezionate quattro ondate: due nel periodo invernale e due in quello estivo. In questi periodi, sono stati analizzati dati provenienti da molteplici sorgenti, in particolare raccolti da stazioni a terra, da radiosondaggi, da satellite, da rianalisi modellistiche e da simulazioni da modelli di trasporto. Le osservazioni dimostrano che tutti gli eventi analizzati in questo lavoro sono stati caratterizzati da aumenti non solo dei valori di temperatura ma anche delle concentrazioni di particolato. La situazione sinottica, comune a tutti gli eventi, � caratterizzata dalla persistenza di un anticiclone per un periodo prolungato, associato a condizioni stazionarie di assenza di precipitazioni e ridotte velocit� del vento. Le analisi sui meccanismi responsabili degli aumenti di particolato evidenziano una differenza tra la stagione invernale e quella estiva. Le ondate di calore invernali sono associate ad un accumulo di particolato di origine locale provocato dall?abbassamento dello strato limite di rimescolamento in atmosfera. Al contrario gli aumenti osservati durante le ondate estive sono associati all?espansione verso nord dell?anticiclone africano, e dal contestuale trasporto di polvere minerale dal deserto del Sahara, mescolata durante il trasporto con polveri di origine antropogenica e fly ashes prodotte da incendi.},

In this thesis, I investigate stresses induced by gravity in volcanic edifices. In particular, I study the orientation of principal stress axes, as these control the direction of
magma propagation by diking. I construct simple axisymmetric volcano topographies inspired by volcanoes in nature and then I test widely used assumptions on the state of stress, to discuss which of these assumptions might be more appropriate for volcano edifices. I also use a simple, recently developed, dike propagation model (Simplified Analytical model, or SAM) to predict dike trajectories in a progressively more realistic edifice stress
field. The results of this study provide new insights into the factors that influence dike propagation and vent opening, highlighting the importance of considering the topographic loading and other stress-modifying processes in the modelling of volcanic eruptions. The study also demonstrates the potential of the SAM model for investigating dike propagation behaviour in volcanic areas.},

	url = {https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5203/},
	abstract = {In the last few decades, Geology courses, particularly in the Global North have seen a decline in student enrolment. Geologists have linked this downturn to a lack of exposure to the subject at school and college level. This work seeks to understand the public’s relationship with Geology and draws on over 5000 open-ended question responses to a survey disseminated in 2021. The survey asked both those who had, and had not, studied geology as a subject a series of questions in order to explore their perceptions of the discipline. Our findings indicate that individuals ‘outside’ of geology see the subject as old fashioned, boring, and environmentally damaging; simply the study of rock samples with nothing new to be discovered from; and with poor job prospects outside of the oil and gas industry. Geologists who responded to the survey paint a picture of a broad, interdisciplinary subject, with vibrant employability opportunities – yet struggle to coherently and collectively describe this when asked, ‘what is geology?’. In addition to the identified perception of geology as boring, and notions of poor employability being a barrier to prospective students, diversity and inclusivity issues are highlighted as significant barriers by those who study geology. Our findings indicate that both geologists and the geology curriculum need to coherently describe what geology is more effectively. We need to develop and better communicate the subject's interdisciplinary nature and links to critical societal issues, such as the role of responsible mineral extraction in the energy transition and the importance of geology in vital areas such as climate change science, water resource management, environmental conservation, and sustainable urban/built development. Finding new ways to show that, far from being boring, geology is a subject that can fundamentally change the way you see and interact with the world around you is of central importance to achieving this. Efforts to make the subject more equitable are also highlighted as being critical in creating a more inclusive and accessible discipline.},

Through the use of a simple spreadsheet, students are shown that something analogous to coin flips will yield the exponential curve describing decay. A similar spreadsheet is then used to show that the exponential curve associated with the penetration depth of radiation is produced through the use of the same kind of random process applied to slices of matter rather than slices of time.

What options are there then for physics teachers to allow their students to experimentally investigate certain characteristics of radioactivity, such as how distance affects the intensity of radiation coming from a radioactive source? There are computer simulations that can be run, or perhaps the teacher has a light sensor and tries to make an analogy between the intensity of light from a light bulb and the intensity of radiation from a radioactive source based on geometric arguments to get an inverse-square law. But for many there is no direct experimental option if one does not possess a Geiger counter and good radioactive sample.

	abstract = {Abstract. Geodynamic modelling provides a powerful tool to investigate processes in the Earth's crust, mantle, and core that are not directly observable. However, numerical models are inherently subject to the assumptions and simplifications on which they are based. In order to use and review numerical modelling studies appropriately, one needs to be aware of the limitations of geodynamic modelling as well as its advantages. Here, we present a comprehensive yet concise overview of the geodynamic modelling process applied to the solid Earth from the choice of governing equations to numerical methods, model setup, model interpretation, and the eventual communication of the model results. We highlight best practices and discuss their implementations including code verification, model validation, internal consistency checks, and software and data management. Thus, with this perspective, we encourage high-quality modelling studies, fair external interpretation, and sensible use of published work. We provide ample examples, from lithosphere and mantle dynamics specifically, and point out synergies with related fields such as seismology, tectonophysics, geology, mineral physics, planetary science, and geodesy. We clarify and consolidate terminology across geodynamics and numerical modelling to set a standard for clear communication of modelling studies. All in all, this paper presents the basics of geodynamic modelling for first-time and experienced modellers, collaborators, and reviewers from diverse backgrounds to (re)gain a solid understanding of geodynamic modelling as a whole.},

	abstract = {The Tyrolean Iceman is known as one of the oldest human glacier mummies, directly dated to 3350–3120 calibrated BCE. A previously published low-coverage genome provided novel insights into European prehistory, despite high present-day DNA contamination. Here, we generate a high-coverage genome with low contamination (15.33) to gain further insights into the genetic history and phenotype of this individual. Contrary to previous studies, we found no detectable Steppe-related ancestry in the Iceman. Instead, he retained the highest Anatolian-farmer-related ancestry among contemporaneous European populations, indicating a rather isolated Alpine population with limited gene ﬂow from hunter-gatherer-ancestry-related populations. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the Iceman likely had darker skin than present-day Europeans and carried risk alleles associated with male-pattern baldness, type 2 diabetes, and obesity-related metabolic syndrome. These results corroborate phenotypic observations of the preserved mummiﬁed body, such as high pigmentation of his skin and the absence of hair on his head.},

              Despite the fact that more than 60 years have passed, the
              α
              -Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) system has not yet been fully understood. Their seminal work stimulated many interdisciplinary research topics in mathematics and physics like integrable systems, soliton theory, ergodic theory, and chaos. In this article, we theoretically investigate the original problem by applying the wave–wave interaction theory. By using this mathematical approach, we are able to explain why the emergence of equipartition requires very long times (inaccessible when the original numerical experiments were performed but nowadays recently observed using computer power). Our approach is general and can be used to attack other problems of weakly nonlinear dispersive waves.
            
          , 
            
              We study the original
              α
              -Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) system with
              N
              = 16, 32, and 64 masses connected by a nonlinear quadratic spring. Our approach is based on resonant wave–wave interaction theory; i.e., we assume that, in the weakly nonlinear regime (the one in which Fermi was originally interested), the large time dynamics is ruled by exact resonances. After a detailed analysis of the
              α
              -FPU equation of motion, we find that the first nontrivial resonances correspond to six-wave interactions. Those are precisely the interactions responsible for the thermalization of the energy in the spectrum. We predict that, for small-amplitude random waves, the timescale of such interactions is extremely large and it is of the order of 1/
              ϵ
              8
              , where
              ϵ
              is the small parameter in the system. The wave–wave interaction theory is not based on any threshold: Equipartition is predicted for arbitrary small nonlinearity. Our results are supported by extensive numerical simulations. A key role in our finding is played by the Umklapp (flip-over) resonant interactions, typical of discrete systems. The thermodynamic limit is also briefly discussed.},

Lincei Memorie 7: 299–368, 1938), regarding the metabolic cost of gradient locomotion, together with recent insights on gait biomechanics, a prediction about the most economical gradient of mountain paths (approximately 25\%) is obtained and interpreted. The pendulum-like mechanism of walking produces a waste of mechanical work against gravity within the gradient range of up to 15\% (the overall efficiency is dominated by the low transmission efficiency), whereas for steeper values only the muscular efficiency is responsible for the (slight) metabolic change (per meter of vertical displacement) with respect to gradient. The speeds at the optimum gradient turned out to be approximately 0.65 m/s (+0.16 m/s vertical) and 1.50 m/s (-0.36 m/s vertical), for uphill and downhill walking, respectively, and the ascensional energy expenditure was 0.4 and 2.0 ml O2.kg body mass-1.vertical m-1 climbed or descended. When the metabolic power becomes a burden, as in high-altitude mountaineering, the optimum gradient should be reduced. A sample of real mountain path gradients, experimentally measured, mimics the obtained predictions.},

	abstract = {Carrying heavy loads in the Himalayan region is a real challenge. Porters face extreme ranges in terrain condition, path steepness, altitude hypoxia and climate for 6–8 h a day, many months a year, since they were boys. It has been previously shown that, when carrying loads on level terrain, porters' metabolic economy is higher than in Caucasians but the reasons are still unknown. We monitored Nepalese porters both during 90 km trekking in Khumbu Valley and at two different altitudes (3490 and 5050 m above sea-level), where they were compared to Caucasian mountaineers during (22\%) gradient walking. Both subject groups carried a load of up to 90\% body mass. The remarkably higher performance of porters during uphill locomotion (+60\% in speed, +39\% mechanical power) is only partly explained by the lower cost of loaded walking (−20\%), being also the result of a better cardio-circulatory adaptation to altitude, which generates a higher mass-specific metabolic power (+30\%). Consequently, Nepalese porters show higher efficiency, both during uphill and downhill loaded walking. Their higher economy on steep paths cannot be ascribed to a better exchange between potential and kinetic energy, as in our experiments the body centre of mass travelled monotonically uphill (or downhill). A different oscillation pattern of the loaded head–trunk segment, together with the analysis of the different components of the mechanical work during load carrying, suggests that achieved motor skills in balancing the loaded body segment above the hip could play a role in determining the better economy of porters.},

The performance is often trivialized through simpliﬁed measures, such as the approach of central tendency, but doing so risks a loss of perspective of the variability and non-determinism of modern computer systems. Authentic performance evaluations are derived from statistical methods that accurately interpret and assess data. Methods that currently exist within performance comparison frameworks are limited in efﬁcacy, statistical inference is either overtly simpliﬁed or altogether avoided. A prevalent criticism from computer performance literature suggests that the results from difference hypothesis testing lack substance. To address this problem, we propose a new framework, SPARC, that pioneers a synthesis of difference and equivalence hypothesis testing to provide relevant conclusions. It is a union of three key components: (i) identifying either superiority or similarity through difference and equivalence hypotheses (ii) scalable methodology (based on the number of benchmarks), and (iii) a conditional feedback loop from test outcomes that produces informative conclusions of relevance, equivalence, trivial, or indeterminant. We present an experimental analysis characterizing the performance of a trio of RISC-V open-source processors to evaluate SPARC and its efﬁcacy compared to similar frameworks.},

Out of 28 disciplines, 9 – accounting for more than half of Italian professors – display a significant paucity of last names. Moreover, in most disciplines a clear north-south trend emerges, with likelihood of nepotism increasing with latitude. Even accounting for the geographic clustering of last names, I find that for many disciplines the probability of name-sharing is boosted when professors work in the same institution or sub-discipline.

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of changes in shoulder and torso angles on the aerodynamic drag and power output of a track cyclist. The drag of three competitive track cyclists was measured in a wind tunnel at 40 kph. Changes in shoulder and torso angles were made using a custom adjustable handlebar setup. The power output was measured for each position using an SRM Power Meter. The power required by each athlete to maintain a speciﬁc speed in each position was calculated, which enabled the surplus power in each position to be determined. The results showed that torso angle inﬂuenced the drag area and shoulder angle inﬂuenced the power output, and that a low torso angle and middle shoulder angle optimised the surplus power. However, the lowest possible torso angle was not always the best position. Although differences between individual riders was seen, there was a strong correlation between torso angle and drag area.},

	abstract = {Bright ﬁreballs or bolides are caused by meteoroids entering the Earth’s atmosphere at high speed. Some have a cometary origin, a few may have originated within the Venus-Earth-Mars region as a result of massive impacts in the remote past but a relevant fraction is likely the result of the break-up of asteroids. Disrupted asteroids produce clusters of fragments or asteroid families and meteoroid streams. Linking a bolide to a certain asteroid family may help to understand its origin and pre-impact dynamical evolution. On 2013 February 15, a superbolide was observed in the skies near Chelyabinsk, Russia. Such a meteor could be the result of the decay of an asteroid and here we explore this possibility applying a multistep approach. First, we use available data and Monte Carlo optimization (validated using 2008 TC3 as template) to obtain a robust solution for the pre-impact orbit of the Chelyabinsk impactor (a = 1.62 au, e = 0.53, i = 3◦. 82, Ω = 326◦. 41 and ω = 109◦. 44). Then, we use this most probable orbit and numerical analysis to single out candidates for membership in, what we call, the Chelyabinsk asteroid family. Finally, we perform N -body simulations to either conﬁrm or reject any dynamical connection between candidates and impactor. We ﬁnd reliable statistical evidence on the existence of the Chelyabinsk cluster. It appears to include multiple small asteroids and two relatively large members: 2007 BD7 and 2011 EO40. The most probable parent body for the Chelyabinsk superbolide is 2011 EO40. The orbits of these objects are quite perturbed as they experience close encounters not only with the Earth-Moon system but also with Venus, Mars and Ceres. Under such conditions, the cluster cannot be older than about 20–40 kyr.},

We present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid. Using evidence gathered by one camera at the Revolution Square in the city of Chelyabinsk and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of Korkino, we calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent encounter with our planet. In order to account for the uncertainties implicit in the determination of the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere, we use Monte Carlo methods to calculate the most probable orbital parameters and their dispersion. Although the orbital elements are aﬀected by uncertainties the orbit has been sucesfully reconstructed. We use it to classify the meteoroid among the near Earth asteroid families ﬁnding that the parent body belonged to the Apollo asteroids.},

	title = {The orbit of the {Chelyabinsk} event impactor as reconstructed from amateur and public footage},
	abstract = {A ballistic reconstruction of a meteoroid orbit can be made if enough information is available about its trajectory inside the atmosphere. A few methods have been devised in the past and used in several cases to trace back the origin of small impactors. On February 15, 2013, a medium-sized meteoroid hit the atmosphere in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia, causing damage in several large cities. The incident, the largest registered since the Tunguska event, was witnessed by many thousands and recorded by hundreds of amateur and public video recording systems. The amount and quality of the information gathered by those systems is sufficient to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectory of the impactor body in the atmosphere, and from this the orbit of the body with respect to the Sun. Using amateur and public footage taken in four different places close to the event, we have determined precisely the properties of the entrance trajectory and the orbit of the Chelyabinsk event impactor. We found that the object entered the atmosphere at a velocity ranging from 16.0 to 17.4 km/s in a grazing trajectory, almost directly from the east, with an azimuth of velocity vector of 285º, and with an elevation of 15.8º with respect to the local horizon. The orbit that best fits the observations has, at a 95\% confidence level, a semi-major axis a = 1.26±0.05 AU, eccentricity e = 0.44±0.03, argument of perihelion ω = 95.5º±2º and longitude of ascending node Ω = 326.5º±0.3º. Using these properties the object can be classified as belonging to the Apollo family of Near Earth Asteroids. The absolute magnitude of the meteoroid was H= 25.8, well below the threshold for its detection and identification as a Potential Hazardous Asteroid (PHA). This result would imply that present efforts intended to detect and characterize PHAs are incomplete and are missing approximately half the objects able to impact our planet and cause local damage.},

This climatology can then be used to put the current state of the snow cover into perspective.

	abstract = {Owing to the current lack of plausible and exhaustive physical pre-eruptive models, often volcanologists rely on the observation of monitoring anomalies to track the evolution of volcanic unrest episodes. Taking advantage from the work made in the development of Bayesian Event Trees (BET), here we formalize an entropy-based model to translate the observation of anomalies into probability of a specific volcanic event of interest. The model is quite general and it could be used as a standalone eruption forecasting tool or to set up conditional probabilities for methodologies like the BET and of the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The proposed model has some important features worth noting: (i) it is rooted in a coherent logic, which gives a physical sense to the heuristic information of volcanologists in terms of entropy; (ii) it is fully transparent and can be established in advance of a crisis, making the results reproducible and revisable, providing a transparent audit trail that reduces the overall degree of subjectivity in communication with civil authorities; (iii) it can be embedded in a unified probabilistic framework, which provides an univocal taxonomy of different kinds of uncertainty affecting the forecast and handles these uncertainties in a formal way. Finally, for the sake of example, we apply the procedure to track the evolution of the 1982–1984 phase of unrest at Campi Flegrei.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Hogg spiega molto meglio i minimi quadrati (Hogg et al., 2010) in molte meno parole.
Questo è una trattazione minima: “Per due punti passa una sola retta, per tre punti, a meno che non siano allineati, non passano rette… come fare se ho tre punti e voglio una retta?

The historic sources cannot confirm whether this actually happened. The technical question whether it could have happened, considering the knowledge and technology then available, is still under discussion. The current thinking is that a row of mirrors similar to a Concentrated Solar Power installation is capable of focusing sufficient light to ignite wood, but also that this would be a very impractical weapon. In this article, it is suggested that the combination of two parabolic mirrors, one large reflector and a small collimator, with a plane mirror as directional device can provide, and direct, sufficient energy to ignite timber. The theoretical knowledge and the technological capabilities available at the time indicate that such a renewable energy weapon could have been possible. The principle may have applications for renewable power production today.},

Previous publications already addressed this subject using simple models, as for the shape of the body and the description of the rain and wind. This paper presents a detailed approach which relies on a more realistic ‘human body’ shape and accounts for the variability in time of both the wind and the raindrop size and velocity distributions. It appears that in some seldom cases with tailwind and light rain, there is an optimum velocity, but in general it is better to run as fast as possible. While ‘running’ instead of ‘walking’ yields signiﬁcant gain, the extra effort required to ‘sprint’ is not always worth it.},

It predicts the existence of gravitational waves (GWs) that stretch and compress spacetime and were detected recently by state-of-the-art interferometer observations. Yet, for those who are not familiar with general relativity, it may be difﬁcult to understand how the GWs actually stretch and compress spacetime. In this paper, after reviewing the fact that the effects of GWs can be understood as a force in Newtonian mechanics, we consider extreme and readily perceivable situations where large-amplitude GWs pass through the human body and the Earth, and demonstrate that GWs cause phenomena that commonly occur in daily life by back-of-the-envelope calculations. Our analysis provides intellectual and pedagogical materials for understanding the nature of GWs for nonexperts in general relativity.},

	abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports indicate that the global mean temperature is about 1 ◦C higher than pre-industrial levels, that this increase is anthropogenic, and that there is a causal relationship between this higher temperature and an increase in frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events. This causal relationship seems at odds with common sense, and may be difficult to explain to non-experts. Thus to appreciate the significance of a one degree increase in global mean temperature, we perform back-of-theenvelope calculations relying on simple physics. We estimate the excess thermal energy trapped in the climate system (oceans, land, atmosphere) from a 1 ◦C increase in global mean temperature, and show that it is thousands of times larger than the estimated energy required to form and maintain a hurricane. Our estimates show that global warming is forming a very large pool of excess energy that could in principle power heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and hurricanes. The arguments presented here are sufficiently simple to be presented in introductory physics classes, and can serve as plausibility arguments showing that even a seemingly small increase in global mean temperature can potentially lead to extreme weather events.},

This volume contributes to the reconstruction of this quite unknown period of Fermi's life, marked however by the publication of the Fermi statistics, a scientific breakthrough which would bring the Italian scientist to international celebrity thanks to its application in several fields of physics. This work is at the base, among other things, of semiconductor physics and therefore of modern electronics. The text also features Enrico Fermi's "Lessons of Rational Mechanics" to Science students and to students from the two-year preparatory course for Engineering studies during the aforementioned time span. The topics Enrico Fermi addressed in his lectures include kinematics and point dynamics, kinematics and statics of rigid systems and system statics in general. Lastly, the lessons contain 'Lagrangia''s equations and some elements of hydromechanics},

Some people get back pain just hearing about the Swiss Army's combat backpack. Future generations should suffer less. The Swiss Army is planning to introduce new clothing in 2022. The less popular cold protection jacket (Käschu) is also being replaced. The new clothing and equipment systems are currently being tested in action.
Since July 2017, around 350 members of the army have been testing the new combat clothing, carrying and hydration systems and “ballistic body armor”. They are “tested in daily use for their benefits and added value,” according to a statement from the VBS. “Technological developments and logistical optimization potential” should be taken into account.
After the troop test has been completed, “the knowledge gained is analyzed and assessed and forms the basis for the decision on troop suitability.” By the way: It's not just the clothing that's new, but also the pattern. The new clothing is being tested in plain colors, but when it is introduced it will be given the “multi-field camouflage pattern 16”. At first glance, however, the author cannot see any significant difference to the old camouflage pattern.
This is what the new “multi-field camouflage pattern 16” looks like. (Image: VBS/DDPS)
Anything new with the equipment? Not quite. The army does not want to forego the tried and tested “onion skin principle”. The user should continue to be able to “individually adapt” their clothing to the temperature and weather conditions in the future. Everyone who was in the recruit school must laugh at the word individual.
The new clothing is to be financed with the Armaments Program 19. The initial procurement is expected to cost 250 million francs. Public tenders are carried out before procurement.

	abstract = {Since its introduction by Svensson in 1959, the power law curve y = axb (where x and y are horizontal and vertical direction, respectively) has been widely used in morphological analysis of glacial trough cross-proﬁles. The numerical constants a and b are obtained by a linear regression analysis of the logarithmic form of the power law curve (ln y = ln a + b ln x). The value b then gives a measure for the form of the cross-section. However, over the years this form of the power law has endured a lot of criticism. This criticism is well founded, since this particular form of the power law is not suitable for curve ﬁtting in morphological analyses. In this paper a general power law is proposed, of the form y − y0 = ax − x0b (where x0, y0 are the coordinates of the origin of the cross-proﬁle). A unique and unbiased solution for this equation is obtained with a general least-squares method, thereby minimizing the error between the cross-proﬁle data and the curve, and not between the logarithmic transform of the data and its regression line. This provides a robust way to characterize trough cross-section forms. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              The fact that the cross‐profile of the glacial valley could be well approximated by parabolas (Y = aX
              b
              , b = 2.0) is explained by the variation principle, assuming that the glacier erosion works towards minimizing thefriction between ice and bedrock. The variation principle proves that the ideal or fully‐developed morphology of the glacial valley should be a catenary, the curve which a chain hanging from two fixed points forms. Maclaurin's series expansion of the catenary equation shows that a parabola is a very good approximation of the catenary; hence, the good approximation of the cross‐profile by parabolas.
            
            
              Different catenaries are generated by changing the form ratio (depth/rim width) and are then approximated by Y = aX
              b
              by the method of last‐squares. The b values obtained become only fractionally larger than 2.0 with invreasing form ratios of up to 1.0, indicating that b values would range, in practice, between 1.0 and about 2.0 Two types of trend in the relationship between b values and the form ratio were obtained from several glaciers. For one type the b value becomes larger with increasing form ratios, and for the other the opposite. The first type is called the Rocky Mountain model after its source of data and represents overdeepening of the glacial valley development. The second type is caalled the Patagonia‐Antarctica model, representing a widening, instead of a deepening, process of development. These differences are attributed to the nature of the glaciers which produced these valleys, i.e. alpine glaciers and continental ice sheets.},

	abstract = {Seismologists have recently begun using low-cost nodal sensors in dense deployments to sample the seismic wavefield at unprecedented spatial resolution. Earthquake early warning systems and other monitoring networks (e.g., wastewater injection) would also benefit from network densification; however, current nodal sensors lack power systems or the real-time data transmission required for these applications. A candidate sensor for these networks may instead be a low-cost, all-in-one package such as the OSOP Raspberry Shake 4D (RS-4D). The RS-4D includes a vertical-component geophone, threecomponent accelerometer, digitizer, and near-real-time miniSEED data transmission and costs only a few hundred dollars per unit. Here, we step through instrument testing of three RS-4Ds at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL). We find that the geophones have sensitivities constrained to within 4\% of nominal, but that they have relatively high self-noise levels compared with the broadband sensors typically used in seismic networks. To demonstrate the impact this would have on characterizing nearby events, we estimate local magnitudes of earthquakes in Oklahoma using Trillium Compact broadband sensor data from U.S. Geological Survey aftershock deployments as well as 23 Raspberry Shakes operated by hobbyists and private owners within the state. We find that for ML 2.0–4.0 earthquakes at distances of 20–100 km from seismic stations, the Raspberry Shakes require events of magnitude ∼0:3 larger than the broadband sensors to reliably estimate ML at a given distance from the epicenter. We conclude that RS-4Ds are suitable for densifying backbone networks designed for studies of local and regional events.},

              For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance
              1–4
              . However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators
              5
              . Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention. We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D
              6
              , the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavourable conditions of low safety factor and low torque. In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER.},

The three main approaches to interval estimation (Neyman confidence, Bayesian, likelihood ratio) are discussed and compared in detail, with and without nuisance parameters. Hypothesis testing is discussed mainly from the frequentist point of view, with pointers to the Bayesian literature. Various foundational issues are emphasized, including the conditionality principle and the likelihood principle.},

	abstract = {A calculation is made of the distribution of stress and velocity in an ideal glacier and in an ideal ice-sheet. The ice is assumed to have a constant yield stress and to obey, like other polycrystalline plastic aggregates, the Levy-Mises equations of flow and either the Mises or the Tresca criterion of yielding. The solution obtained for an ideal glacier represents the two-dimensional flow of a long slab of ice down a gently undulating rough slope. The addition of ice to the upper surface by snowfall and the removal of ice by ablation are allowed for, but the frictional resistance of the sides of the glacier valley is neglected. Two states of flow are possible, ‘active’ and ‘passive’, corresponding to the active and passive Rankine states in soil mechanics. Which of these states occurs at a given place depends upon the relative magnitudes of the curvature of the bed and the rate of snowfall or ablation; a simple algebraic expression of this dependence is obtained. In both states of flow the velocity is greatest at the surface and decreases with depth according to an elliptical law. It is shown that, in accordance with observation, crevasses of limited depth can open in active flow but not in passive flow. The slip-line field for the problem has a close connexion with the directions and positions of shear faults (although the laminated structure of a glacier is doubtless also an important factor here). In passive flow the faults to be expected are similar to the ‘thrust planes’ often seen on glaciers. The theory suggests that in active flow a complementary sort of shear fault with the opposite direction of movement may occur—and there is some observational evidence for this. The tendency of glaciers to accentuate hollows in their beds is connected with the suggestion that erosion should proceed faster under passive flow than under active flow. The second solution obtained is formally similar but represents the two-dimensional flow of a large ice-sheet, such as the Greenland ice-cap. If a horizontal bed is assumed the profile is calculated to be formed from parts of two parabolas, the maximum height being given by the yield stress of ice. In the accumulation area flow is active. The maximum velocity is every­ where at the surface while the maximum shear rate is on the bed. The solution thus gives no support to the belief that the weight of ice above squeezes out the underlying ice at a faster rate.},

The “shooting of a noon sight” and its “reduction to a position” grew to become a daily practice at the start of the 19th century1 following the perfection of the marine chronometer by John Harrison and its mass production.2 This technique is still practiced by navigators in this age of GPS. Indeed, the U.S. Coast Guard exams for ocean-going licenses include celestial navigation.3 These techniques continue to be used by the military and by private sailors as a backup to all-too-fallible and jammable electronic navigation systems. A sextant, a nautical almanac,4 special sight reduction tables,5 and involved calculations are needed to determine position to the nearest mile using the Sun, Moon, stars, or planets. Yet, finding latitude and longitude to better than 30 miles from measurements of the Sun's altitude is easily within the capability of those taking astronomy or physics for the first time by applying certain basic principles. Moreover, it shows a practical application of astronomy in use the world over. The streamlined method described here takes advantage of the similar level of accuracy of its three components: 1.Observations using a homemade quadrant6 (instead of a sextant), 2. Student-made graphs of the altitude of the Sun over a day7 (replacing lengthy calculation using sight reduction tables), and 3. An averaged 20-year analemma used to find the Sun's navigational coordinates8,9 (rather than the 300+ page Nautical Almanac updated yearly).},

Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available—and is willing to use—concerning, e.g., the survey and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates nonpositive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.},

The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create “well-formed hypotheses,” as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop wellthought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.},

In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

From the context alone the reader cannot possibly infer whether "e" represents probable error, 3-sigma limits, systematic error, or some combination of random and systematic errors. As a co nsequence, the quality of the results, and the validity of inference drawn from these results, are to a large extent left to the judgment and guesswork of the reader.

              Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, we know that neutrinos have non-zero mass. However, the absolute neutrino-mass scale remains unknown. Here we report the upper limits on effective electron anti-neutrino mass,

Information on this specific plastic is scantily reported in the literature and as a consequence a preponderance of authors unknowingly reference an article by Shonka describing an early version of a tissue substitute plastic but having a different elemental composition than the present A‐150 formulation. We have reviewed the results of 21 chemical analyses which have occurred over a time span of four years on a total of 14 samples of A‐150 plastic and based on these data and the formulation of the plastic, have arrived at a suggested composition for A‐150 tissue‐equivalent plastic. The ambiguities of water absorption by nylon, one of the components of of the plastic, and the uncertainty this reflects in the composition of the plastic were evaluated.},

	abstract = {An elegant analysis of how animals work and function. Professor Schmidt-Nielsen's incisive account gives a clear understanding of comparative physiology in relation to body size, form and function, energy supply, and environment. The author is concerned with principles. For example, he explains how difficult it may be to lose heat and water from the respiratory tract. This leads to a consideration of the mechanism of panting as a means of heat loss. The author describes the centuries-old problem of how birds breathe, which now has been solved in his laboratory. He then discusses energy expenditure for swimming, running, and flying, and the effects of activity on heat balance. The ability of mammals to maintain different parts of the body at different temperatures is explained on the basis of counter-current heat exchange; a related mechanism permits the fast-swimming tuna to enjoy some of the advantages of being warm-blooded. The problems raised by being small in size, or large, are considered in detail. It is shown that many physiological variables can be placed on a scale which permits the derivation of non-dimensional numbers to describe the interrelations between different parameters. This interesting and stimulating account was written primarily for students, but since it brings together and synthesizes much new and up-to-date information it will interest all biologists and physiologists.},

Topics covered include regression, parameter estimation, model assessment, and Monte Carlo methods, as well as widely used classical methods such as regularization and hypothesis testing. The emphasis throughout is on the principles, the unifying probabilistic approach, and showing how the methods can be implemented in practice. R code (with explanations) is included and is available online, so readers can reproduce the plots and results for themselves. Aimed primarily at undergraduate and graduate students, these techniques can be applied to a wide range of data analysis problems beyond the scope of this work.},

	abstract = {Il presente lavoro, svolto presso il servizio di Fisica Sanitaria dell?Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria di Parma, consiste nello sviluppo di un metodo innovativo di radioterapia adattativa.
Il metodo � stato applicato a pazienti affetti da varie patologie, trattati con tecnica VMAT, (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy), altamente conformata al target.
Il metodo sviluppato si compone di due fasi: nella prima fase vengono effettuate due analisi su immagini portali, di ricostruzione della dose all'isocentro e l'analisi gamma 2D. Se almeno una di queste fallisce, si interviene con la seconda fase, che vede l'acquisizione della CBCT del paziente e la taratura in densit� elettronica della stessa. Si calcola dunque il piano su CBCT, previa operazione di contouring da parte del medico e, infine, si esegue l'analisi gamma 3D sulle matrici di dose calcolate sulla CT e sulla CBCT del paziente, quantificando gli indici gamma sulle strutture PTV, CTV e OAR di interesse clinico. In base ai risultati, se necessario, si pu� intervenire sul piano di trattamento.
Le analisi gamma 2D e 3D sono state svolte avvalendosi di un software toolkit chiamato GADD-23 (Gamma Analysis on 2D and 3D Dose Distributions) implementato e sviluppato appositamente in ambiente Matlab per questo lavoro di tesi; in particolare, la realizzazione di GADD-23 � stata resa possibile grazie all'interazione con due software di tipo open-source, Elastix e CERR, specifici per l?elaborazione e la registrazione di immagini mediche.
I risultati ottenuti mostrano come il metodo sviluppato sia in grado di mettere in luce cambiamenti anatomici che alcuni pazienti hanno sub�to, di tipo sistematico, in cui � possibile prendere in considerazione una ripianificazione del trattamento per correggerli, o di tipo casuale, sui quali pu� essere utile condurre l'attenzione del medico radioterapista, sebbene non sia necessario un replanning.},

Nell?ambito clinico, al fine di una diagnosi accurata, � necessario avere una buona qualit� dell?immagine radiologica mantenendo il pi� basso livello di dose rilasciata al paziente.
Elemento fondamentale per ottenere questo risultato � la scelta del rivelatore di radiazione X, che deve garantire prestazioni fisiche (contrasto, risoluzione spaziale e rumore) adeguati alla specifica procedura. Le metriche oggettive che misurano queste caratteristiche sono SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) ed NPS (Noise Power Spectrum), che insieme contribuiscono alla misura della DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency), il parametro pi� completo e adatto a stabilire le performance di un sistema di imaging. L?oggettivit� di queste misure consente anche di mettere a confronto tra loro diversi sistemi di rivelazione.
La misura di questi parametri deve essere effettuata seguendo precisi protocolli di fisica medica, che sono stati applicati al rivelatore PaxScan4030CB presente nel laboratorio del Centro di Coordinamento di Fisica Medica, Policlinico S.Orsola.
I risultati ottenuti, conformi a quelli dichiarati dal costruttore, sono stati confrontati con successo con alcuni lavori presenti in letteratura e costituiscono la base necessaria per la verifica di procedure di ottimizzazione dell?immagine radiologica attraverso interventi sul processo di emissione dei raggi X e sul trattamento informatico dell?immagine (Digital Subtraction Angiography).},

	abstract = {The estimation of the magnitude of extreme winds, and of the risk of their being exceeded, is an essential part of the assessment of wind loads on structures. This paper surveys the various methods available for extreme value analysis which are directly applicable to wind data. These are of two types: those making use of a sampling procedure to derive the parameters of an extreme value distribution, and those which make estimates directly from the total or parent population of wind speeds. The former is a well established technique appropriate to the majority of applications, and will be described in greater detail.
There is some disagreement among wind engineers as to the correct or most useful analytic form for the extreme value distribution of winds. In this paper it is argued that for temperate latitudes, where fully developed weather systems are the dominant cause of strong winds, the extreme value distribution is a Fisher-Tippett (Type I). There is a sound theoretical basis for the use of this distribution. In regions where there is a significant risk of strong winds originating from tropical cyclones and tornadoes a Fisher-Tippett (Type II) distribution may possess certain practical advantages, but a full solution of the problem of wind prediction in these areas should be based upon a different statistical approach, tailored to model these particular wind phenomena. This requires development and an accumulation of suitable meteorological data before it can be fully implemented.
Brief mention is made of methods of estimating extreme winds from the parent population of wind speeds. This has application in cases where there is a very limited length of meteorological records, and also for the analysis of extremes on a directional basis where the more common methods are inapplicable.
The paper is concerned with principles and does not include a detailed mathematical treatment of the topic, which should be south in the references.},

	title = {Human‐induced risk drives behavioural decisions in a recovering brown bear population},
	abstract = {In human-dominated landscapes, rebounding bear populations share space with people, which may lead to bear–human conﬂicts and, consequently, a decrease in acceptance and an increase in bear mortality linked to human causes. Previous analyses of brown bear (Ursus arctos) movement data have shown that bears adopt a security-food trade-off strategy in response to variable human-related risk. However, brown bear ﬂexibility to cope with these risky situations may be reduced when resting, mating or stocking fat in preparation for hibernation. In this study, we measured the multi-scale spatial response of brown bears to human-related risk and food resource distribution in a highly heterogeneous human-dominated landscape. We examined habitat selection both within the population range (‘secondorder’ selection) and at bedding site locations (‘third-order’) for GPS-tagged brown bears of a recently reintroduced population in the Italian Alps. We identiﬁed resting locations by ﬁeld-validated spatio-temporal cluster analysis of telemetry locations. We mapped food availability and distribution using dynamic geographic layers of fruiting wild berries, and human-related risk using human mobility data (Strava-based Cumulated Outdoor activity Index). Brown bears appeared to compromise their need for food resources for avoidance of anthropogenic disturbance when selecting home ranges, as they utilized areas richer in wild berries less when human use of outdoor tracks was higher. Furthermore, selection of resting site locations strongly depended on the avoidance of human-related risk only, with less frequented, more concealed and inaccessible sites being selected. We conclude that humans compete for space with bears beyond their infrastructural impact, that is, by actively occupying key areas for bear survival, thereby potentially restricting the bears’ realized niche. We propose mitigating actions to promote bear–human coexistence by selectively restricting human access to key areas during sensitive annual physiological phases for bear survival.},

These are exceptionally well planned to bring out essential points of the text and are models of clarity and artistic design, especially the three‐dimensional cutaway diagrams of tectonic and geomorphic features. Many new drawings and photos have been incorporated in this 8th edition, including dramatic pictures of planetary surfaces. Each of the 25 chapters begins with an opening statement that puts the chapter in a larger context and closes with a list of key terms, some thought‐provoking review questions, a list of suggested readings in more advanced works, and—a novel and useful feature—a list of Web sites germane to the chapter. An illustrated glossary and a useful index complete the book. Pages feature wake‐up questions for the student, such as “How do we know that streams erode the valleys through which they flow?”},

	abstract = {La tesi riguarda una analisi di come il concetto di infinitesimo e differenziale sono trattati nei libri di testo di matematica e di fisica a livello universitario. Lo studio si inquadra nel tema pi� generale del ruolo della matematica nell'insegnamento/apprendimento della fisica. La tesi � articolata in quattro capitoli e le conclusioni. Nel primo capitolo si riportano i principali quadri teorici elaborati per riflettere sul ruolo della matematica nell'apprendimento della fisica, e per riconoscere le forme di ragionamento messe in atto da esperti e/o studenti nei processi di modellizzazione matematica o di problem solving. I quadri teorici principali a cui si fa riferimento sono: il quadro di Redish sul processo di modellizzazione, utilizzato anche per indagare i cosiddetti ?epistemic games? messi in atto dagli studenti nella soluzione di problemi, e il modello di Uhden, Karam, Pietrocola e Pospiech. Nel secondo capitolo si ripercorre la storia del concetto di infinitesimo e differenziale a partire dalle concezioni di Newton e Leibniz fino alla nascita dell'analisi non-standard. Le nozioni dell'Analisi verranno formulate e messe a confronto tra Analisi Standard e Non Standard. Nel terzo capitolo si riportano studi di ricerca di didattica della matematica e della fisica sull'apprendimento/insegnamento dei concetti di infinitesimo e differenziale. Le risorse emerse dalla ricerca sul concetto di differenziale e di infinitesimo e sul ruolo della matematica nei processi di insegnamento/apprendimento della fisica, sono state utilizzate nel capitolo 4 per analizzare una selezione di alcuni libri di matematica e di fisica del '900. L'ambito scelto per l'analisi dei libri di fisica � quello della cinematica, in quanto si incontrano per la prima volta i concetti di variazione di spazio e tempo nella velocit� istantanea, ed � possibile individuare differenti tipologie di approccio didattico nel ragionamento che conduce alle equazioni del moto.},

            In a scientific context, a suitable color choice is more than simple decoration. Color handling, as part of scientific visualization, is a scientific methodology that is one of the most widely used, given the importance of figures and images in conveying results. Yet, an expert‐level understanding and application of proper scientific coloring is rare. Here, a concise overview of important color tools is provided and complemented by ready‐to‐apply resources for using color in science research, publishing, communication, tool development, editing, and teaching. This overview offers a guide to spot problems, master the methodology, and support accessible and accurate use of color for science figures in both short and long terms. © 2024 The Author(s).

In order to permit the incorporation of any a priori information about parameters and any distribution of data (not only of gaussian type) we propose to formulate the problem not using single quantities (such as bounds, means, etc.) but using probability density functions for data and parameters. We also want our formulation to allow for the incorporation of theoretical errors, i.e. non-exact theoretical relationships between data and parameters (due to discretization, or incomplete theoretical knowledge); to do that in a natural way we propose to define general theoretical relationships also as probability density functions. We show then that the inverse problem may be formulated as a problem of combination of information: the experimental information about data, the a priori information about parameters, and the theoretical information. With this approach, the general solution of the non-linear inverse problem is unique and consistent (solving the same problem, with the same data, but with a different system of parameters does not change the solution).},

The schemes of solution of this problem by the trial-and-error method and the inversion method are described. Mathematical and computational problems involved in the solution are outlined. Not all these problems are solved at the present time. Among them optimal parametrization of cross-section and the determination of a probability distribution function for cross-section are the most urgent problems. But with certain limitations the described scheme of a trial-and-error method for joint interpretation of surface and body waves is in routine operation now. Results obtained are described in papers [2, 4, 6, 15, 22, 231. Usually it is the non-uniqueness that strikes us when we see the solution of the inverse problem. But there is another side to the matter: if we do not look for an excessively detailed cross-section we may obtain quite definite conclusions even from very rough observations which are commonly regarded as useless.},

              Nevil Maskelyne’s 1774 experiment on the Scottish mountain Schiehallion set out to derive the mean density of the Earth, from astronomical observations of the deflection of the vertical and calculation of the mountain’s relative gravitational attraction. Using Maskelyne’s results and lithological survey results, John Playfair estimated mean Earth specific gravity to be 4.56–4.87, while Charles Hutton argued in 1821 that the Earth was ‘very near five times the density of water; but not higher’. Hutton challenged future workers to identify any areas in which his analysis could be improved. The geometry of the 1774 experiment has therefore been recomputed within a digital elevation model extending 120 km from the mountain. Three contributions to the deflection of the vertical have been included: topography, and local and regional subsurface density variations. Local subsurface densities have been modelled using geological maps, cross-sections and laboratory measurements. Regional subsurface effects have been included from analysis of the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The outcome of the new modelling is to credit Maskelyne for his accurate astronomical observations, as together with the new density structure model, they yield a mean Earth density of 5480 ± 250 kgm

One set of experiments determined the variation in gravity with altitude using a pendulum at sea level, Quito (2,860 m) and the summit of Pichincha (4,784 m). Qualitatively correct, Bouguer reported a smaller decrease in gravity than that predicted from altitude increase alone, but he calculated that the mean density of the Earth was nearly five times that of the near-surface rocks, an overestimate by a factor of at least two. The better reported experiment was an attempt to detect the deflection of the vertical near the mountain Chimborazo. There was a large difference between Bouguer's predicted plumb-line deflection, 103", and that which he and La Condamine measured, just 7". I have investigated both experiments using a digital elevation model to compute the vertical and horizontal components of the gravity field caused by topography, and include the regional gravity signature of the Andean crustal root. The modelling indicates not only that Bouguer's pendulum measurements were extremely accurate, but also that his observations allow a good determination of the significant isostatic effect. In contrast, on Chimborazo, contrary to recent suggestions, isostatic effects are negligible, and Bouguer's deflection was, within error, in line with the modelled plumb-line deflection from topography. Both Bouguer's pendulum and plumb-line measurements were reliable and therefore he should now be redeemed from any inference of failure.},

I present a virtual realization of an experiment at the Giza pyramids to investigate how Hutton’s concept might have emerged had it been undertaken as he suggested. The attraction of the Great Pyramid would have led to inward north–south deﬂections of the vertical totalling 1.8 arcsec (0.0005◦), and east–west deﬂections totalling 2.0 arcsec (0.0006◦), which although small, would have been within the contemporaneous detectable range, and potentially given, as Hutton wished, a more accurate Earth density measurement than he reported from the Schiehallion experiment.},

              ), but none have been reported from the eastern fjords. In September 2023, we detected the start of a 9-day-long, global 10.88-millihertz (92-second) monochromatic very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning–induced rock-ice avalanche of 25 × 10

              cubic meters plunging into Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 × 10
              11
              newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative to the fjord, demonstrating how a seiche directly caused the 9-day-long seismic signal. Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.

            Editor’s summary
            
              A large rockslide occurred in Greenland on 16 September 2023 that generated a local tsunami. The event was energetic enough to generate a global signal that resonated for 9 days. Svennevig
              et al
              . used a range of geophysical tools to detail the sequence of events that occurred and then determined the origin of the global signal. The authors found that the signal was generated by standing waves in the Dickson fjord due to the rockslide. Climate change drives feedback among the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and mass wasting events, and signals such as the one the authors observed may provide a different way of understanding these interactions. —Brent Grocholski},

Grazie al confronto con i gruppi degli adiacenti areali di studio, � stato possibile ricostruire una carta geologica tra Passo Rolle e Passo Valles pi� a Nord.

Il rinvenimento di formazioni permiane nella porzione occidentale dell?area di studio (Ignimbriti del Distretto Vulcanico Atesino, Arenarie di Val Gardena e Formazione a Bellerophon) � stato correlato ai membri del Werfen rinvenuti a Est tramite supposizione di una struttura di carattere tettonico.

Permiano inferiore (Sakmariano) fino al Triassico medio (Ladinico) ed � disposta con le
formazioni pi� antiche a nord che passano a quelle sempre pi� giovani andando verso sud.
Questa distribuzione stratigrafica ci permette di comprendere al meglio la graduale
evoluzione dovuta al rifting di Pangea che ha portato ad una generale trasgressione marina,
osservabile dalla presenza di successioni pi� antiche e di mare basso che lasciano il posto a
formazioni pi� recenti e di mare profondo.
Sebbene il generale andamento concorde con la stratigrafia, vengono ritrovate alcune
discordanze stratigrafiche dovute all?azione di strutture tettoniche che portano alla creazione
di dislocazioni e rigetti all?interno delle formazioni.

	abstract = {The Port Askaig Formation is a succession of Cryogenian glacial deposits found near the middle of the 25 km thick Dalradian Supergroup. On the Isle of Islay, Scotland, the Port Askaig Formation is approximately 750 mthick in the north and thins over approximately 30 km to a few tens of meters towards the southern end ofthe island. The thinning of this stratum was investigated by performing a literary review of previous works to construct six stratigraphic columns and three cross-sections across the eastern half of Islay. Two models were developed using these cross-sections and columns to explain the thinning of the Port Askaig Formation on Islay. The syndepositional model suggests that the Dalradian sediments were deposited during the late Neoproterozoic Era in an extensional basin over an array of listric normal faults with increasing tectonic activity resulting in lateral thickness changes over short distances. The synorogenic model suggeststhe Dalradian Basin was subjected to deformation in the Caledonian Orogeny during the Ordovician Period. The basin experienced both extensional and compressional stresses resulting in thickness changes throughfolding, faulting, and shearing of the Dalradian sediments. It can be concluded that the major control of thinning of the Port Askaig Formation is due to basin tectonics, followed by the folding of the Dalradian Basin by compressive stresses.},

	abstract = {In order to create a sustainable classification of igneous rocks which all geologists might use, an international body was set up by the IUGS: the IUGS Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks. In the course of creating the classification, the Subcommission has established ten principles for its construction and for defining an appropriate nomenclature. The principles are: (1) use descriptive attributes; (2) use actual properties; (3) ensure suitability for all geologists; (4) use current terminology; (5) define boundaries of rock species; (6) keep it simple to apply; (7) follow natural relations; (8) use modal mineralogy; (9) if mode not feasible, use chemistry; (10) follow terminology of other IUGS advisory bodies. These principles and their rationale have not previously been enunciated.
            
              The classification separates and individually classifies the pyroclastic, carbonatitic, melititic, lamprophyric and charnockitic rocks before entering the main QAPF classification for plutonic and volcanic rocks which is based on the modal mineral proportions of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A) and plagioclase (P) or of alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P) and feldspathoids (F). Rocks with mafic content {\textgreater}90\% have their own classification. If the mineral mode cannot be determined as is often the case for volcanic rocks, then a chemical classification of total alkalis versus silica (TAS) is used. The nomenclature for these classifications necessitates only 297 rock names out of the

It takes a hands-on, project-based approach, with each chapter focusing on an intriguing physics problem taken from classical mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics. To solve these problems, students must apply different numerical methods for themselves, building up their knowledge and practical skills organically. Each project includes a discussion of the fundamentals, the mathematical formulation of the problem, an introduction to the numerical methods and algorithms, and exercises, with solutions available to instructors. The methods presented focus primarily on differential equations, both ordinary and partial, as well as basic mathematical operations. Developed over many years of teaching a computational modelling course, this stand-alone book equips students with an essential numerical modelling toolkit for today's data-driven landscape, and gives them new ways to explore science and engineering.},

The book provides code that is largely unavailable elsewhere and includes details on interpreting and evaluating Bayesian models. Initial discussions offer models in synthetic form so that readers can easily adapt them to their own data; later the models are applied to real astronomical data. The consistent focus is on hands-on modeling, analysis of data, and interpretation to address scientific questions. A must-have for astronomers, the book's concrete approach will also be attractive to researchers in the sciences more broadly.},

Up-to-date coverage of control of networks and complex systems, and a thorough discussion of the fundamental limits of control, including the limitations placed by causality, information theory, and thermodynamics are included. In addition it explores important recent advances in stochastic thermodynamics on the thermodynamic costs of information processing and control.

This detailed guide to data modeling in the sciences is ideal for students and researchers keen to develop their understanding of probabilistic data modeling beyond the basics of p-values and fitting residuals. The textbook begins with basic probabilistic concepts, models of dynamical systems and likelihoods are then presented to build the foundation for Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo samplers and filtering.

	abstract = {The Earth is a dynamic system. Internal processes, together with external gravitational forces of the Sun, Moon and planets, displace the Earth's mass, impacting on its shape, rotation and gravitational field. Doug Smylie provides a rigorous overview of the dynamical behaviour of the solid Earth, explaining the theory and presenting methods for numerical implementation. Topics include advanced digital analysis, earthquake displacement fields, Free Core Nutations observed by the Very Long Baseline Interferometric technique, translational modes of the solid inner core observed by the superconducting gravimeters, and dynamics of the outer fluid core. This book is supported by freeware computer code, available online for students to implement the theory. Online materials also include a suite of graphics generated from the numerical analysis, combined with 100 graphic examples in the book to make this an ideal tool for researchers and graduate students in the fields of geodesy, seismology and solid earth geophysics. The book covers broadly applicable subjects such as the analysis of unequally spaced time series by Singular Value Decomposition, as well as specific topics on Earth Dynamics.},

By examining the practical meaning of probability, this book discusses what is meant by a '95 percent interval of measurement uncertainty', and how such an interval can be calculated. The book argues that the concept of an unknown 'target value' is essential if probability is to be used as a tool for evaluating measurement uncertainty. It uses statistical concepts, such as a conditional confidence interval, to present 'extended' classical methods for evaluating measurement uncertainty. The use of the Monte Carlo principle for the simulation of experiments is described. Useful for researchers and graduate students, the book also discusses other philosophies relating to the evaluation of measurement uncertainty. It employs clear notation and language to avoid the confusion that exists in this controversial field of science.},

It covers the mineralogy, chemistry, textures, and sedimentary structures that characterise sedimentary rocks, and relates these features to the depositional origin of the rocks and their subsequent alteration by diagenetic processes during burial. In addition to detailed sections on siliciclastic and carbonate rocks, it also discusses evaporites, cherts, iron-rich sedimentary rocks, phosphorites, and carbonaceous sedimentary rocks such as oil shales. This second edition maintains the comprehensive treatment of sedimentary petrography and petrology provided in the first edition, and has been updated with new concepts and cutting-edge techniques like cathodoluminescence imaging of sedimentary rocks and backscattered electron microscopy. It is ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in sedimentary petrology, and is a key reference for researchers and professional petroleum geoscientists.},

During times of ice-free global climate, they are recycled to the oceans and the isotopic ratio remains in a stable balance corresponding to the natural proportions of the two isotopes in the hydrosphere. However, glacial ice is composed of condensed 16O-enriched water so that continental ice buildups are preferentially enriched in 16O, with the result that the d18O content of the oceans is increased. Sediments preserve the isotopic ratios of the oxygen that existed in the hydrosphere at the time the sediments were formed. Measurements are made on the carbonate comprising foraminiferal tests. Emiliani (1955) was the first to demonstrate that the oxygen isotope record is cyclic, and was among the first to argue that the fluctuations should reflect the high-frequency oscillations between glacial and interglacial stages that have characterized the Cenozoic record.” (Miall, 2022, p. 384)
“We now know that the 16O/18O ratio is a highly sensitive indicator of global ocean temperatures and ice cover, and” (Miall, 2022, p. 384)“can therefore be used as an analog recorder of ice volumes” (Miall, 2022, p. 385)
“Following, in particular, the pioneering work of Hays et al. (1976) the SPECMAP project established a detailed record for the late Pleistocene (the last 780 ka) which calibrated the scale against an insolation energy index calculated from the integration of the three major orbital cycles, obliquity, precession and eccentricity.” (Miall, 2022, p. 386)

“Glacial ice is present at a density of 0.83–0.917 g cm−3 (Paterson 1994). This can still contain up to 13\% air, but unlike firn, the air bubbles are isolated and no longer form a coherent cavity. In other words, glacier ice is not permeable to air.” (Hagg, 2022, p. 20)

The chemical or isotopic composition and the crystalline structure of clays is based on some relatively simple laws. Abundant illustrations help to understand the subject and can be used in courses. The organization of the book follows a logical structure. From the representation of the structure of minerals, the determination of their crystalline state by using X-ray diffractometer measurements (and other techniques) the thermodynamic and kinematic conditions of their formation is reconstructed. Then the genesis and alteration of the clays at their natural occurrences is discussed. In the last chapter it is stressed that clay minerals can form in variety of different environments: meteorites, lavas, subduction zones for example. The book is aimed for graduate students and scientists (geologists, geographers, engineers, environmental and soil scientists) who want to get a comprehensive introduction in the topic},

	abstract = {We present a 5.3‐Myr stack (the “LR04” stack) of benthic δ
              18
              O records from 57 globally distributed sites aligned by an automated graphic correlation algorithm. This is the first benthic δ
              18
              O stack composed of more than three records to extend beyond 850 ka, and we use its improved signal quality to identify 24 new marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene. We also present a new LR04 age model for the Pliocene‐Pleistocene derived from tuning the δ
              18
              O stack to a simple ice model based on 21 June insolation at 65°N. Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model constraints to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning strategy, the LR04 benthic stack exhibits significant coherency with insolation in the obliquity band throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in the precession band for more than half of the record. The LR04 stack contains significantly more variance in benthic δ
              18
              O than previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result of higher‐resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater percentage of records from the Atlantic. Finally, the relative phases of the stack's 41‐ and 23‐kyr components suggest that the precession component of δ
              18
              O from 2.7–1.6 Ma is primarily a deep‐water temperature signal and that the phase of δ
              18
              O precession response changed suddenly at 1.6 Ma.},

Preceding glaciation, orogenesis and uplift increased the Earth's albedo and decreased temperature. Lowering of temperature below a certain threshold value permitted the astronomical cause to become operative. While smaller glaciations may have been largely or entirely patterned by the astronomical cause or causes, terrestrial factors had an important effect in determining the course of the larger glaciations. Two time-delay factors are believed to have been responsible for the oscillatory pattern of glaciation: these are plastic iceflow, and crustal warping.},

L’intento dell’iniziativa non è quello dell’autocelebrazione di una fase che è stata indubbiamente molto positiva nella vita plurisecolare del nostro ateneo, ma di porre in evidenza gli esiti che ha conseguito la sua ricerca sul piano nazionale e internazionale; le reti scientifiche che intorno a queste attività sono nate e si sono sviluppate; l’attività formativa che ne è seguita; i rapporti con le imprese, le amministrazioni pubbliche e altri comparti della vita civile cittadina e regionale. Questa ricognizione, che non è solo di memoria, si propone anche l’obiettivo di segnalare i possibili livelli di crescita e di intersezione tra le frontiere della scienza e della tecnologia e le esigenze della vita poiché la ricerca e la formazione sono chiamate a svolgere compiti molto rilevanti nella società della conoscenza.},

	abstract = {Ocean Drilling Program Site 806 in the western Pacific shows evidence of a remarkably constant average sedimentation rate. This feature allows us to analyze ancient climate proxies without the need for “orbital tuning,” a standard procedure in prior work, but one that can lead to biased results. Spectral analysis of stable oxygen isotope ratios at this site, a proxy for global ice volume, shows a single narrow peak with a period ≈ 100 k.y., a result that supports our model which links glacial cycles to variations in the inclination of the Earth’s orbit. In contrast, spectral analysis of the coarse component fraction of the sediment (primarily foraminifera) shows a structure characteristic of standard Milankovitch theory, with a triplet of peaks with periods near those expected from the Earth’s eccentricity: 95, 125, and 400 k.y. Bispectral analysis confirms these linkages but suggests that orbital inclination also plays some role in the coarse fraction. From the clear presence of both signals in different proxies at the same site, we conclude that although eccentricity affected the local climate, it is orbital inclination that drove the variations in the global ice volume for the past million years.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the melting of ice ﬂoating on the ocean will introduce a volume of water about 2.6 per cent greater than that of the originally displaced sea water. The melting of ﬂoating ice in a global warming will cause the ocean to rise. If all the extant sea ice and ﬂoating shelf ice melted, the global sea level would rise about 4 cm. The sliding of grounded ice into the sea, however, produces a mean water level rise in two parts; some of the rise is delayed. The ﬁrst part, while the ice ﬂoats, is equal to the volume of displaced sea water. The second part, equal to 2.6 per cent of the ﬁrst, is contributed as it melts. These effects result from the difference in volume of equal weights of fresh and salt water. This component of sea rise is apparently unrecognized in the literature to date, although it can be interpreted as a form of halosteric sea level change by regarding the displaced salt water and the meltwater (even before melting) as a unit. Although salinity changes are known to affect sea level, all existing analyses omit our calculated volume change. We present a protocol that can be used to calculate global sea level rise on the basis of the addition of meltwater from grounded and ﬂoating ice; of course thermosteric volume change must be added.},

The Italian textbooks do not clearly explain why the abovementioned phenomenon occurs. The explanations are qualitative and they may lead to misinterpretation. I have noted that the students are very curious about this phenomenon. They sought a demonstration from books and from the web; and when they do not find it they asked me. Moreover, they have allowed me to observe that there are contradictory statements about the melting of icebergs. Some authors claim that they would not raise the sealevel, others say the opposite. Honestly speaking, I had never thought about this phenomenon and in classroom I tried to give them proof, expressing my opinion about the melting of icebergs.},

The analysis shows the wrong conventional answer is due to the wrong assumption that water from a melted iceberg has the same density as seawater. An iceberg is freshwater ice.5 The sea level rise is essentially due to the difference in the density of seawater (1024 kg/m3) and freshwater (1000 kg/m3). A simple experiment, suitable as an introductory laboratory exercise, that validates the predicted sea level rise is presented at the end of the paper.},

However, many students believe that the buoyant force is determined by the object’s attributes, such as the shape (e.g., ship) or material (e.g., wood). As a result, students find it challenging to understand that buoyant force changes when different volumes of the same object are submerged in water, or when the same object is submerged in different fluids. In response to the question concerning whether the weight of a cup changes when a tea bag is placed in a cup of water, 63.3\% of first-year university students who majored in physics or chemistry were wrong. The problems related to buoyant force are difficult to understand even for college students, so the topic is used in the selection process for gifted students. Although numerous educational attempts have been made to help students understand the concept, buoyant force is still a difficult concept for them. Thus, an easy and clear approach to help students understand the buoyant force is desirable.},

	volume = {209},
	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AAS...20920905N},
	abstract = {Archimedes stated that a floating body displaces its own weight of liquid, but his law has been widely misapplied to ice floating in the oceans by scientists who assumed that equal weights correspond to equal liquid volumes. It is often said that when floating ice melts, the sea level does not rise "because of Archimedes' law." True when ice floats in fresh water, but a myth for ice in oceans! Most ice floating in the oceans is nearly pure water. When it melts, the pure water produced has about 2.6\% more volume than the salt water that was displaced, and the ocean slightly rises. It is often suggested that students demonstrate the "fact" of no rise in the sea surface by melting ice cubes floating in a glass of water; such a demonstration even appears in the movie "An Inconvenient Truth." Let's teach students to spot such errors. We highlight a couple more "surprise issues." First, the density of the floating ice, if it is free of salt and dirt, is irrelevant, so long as it floats. Next, when "grounded" ice (resting on land), enters the sea, it initially displaces less water than its melted form will eventually add to the sea. Thus, an event of that kind, such as formation of an iceberg, produces a rise of the sea level in two stages. We conclude with a series of thought-experiments that could help teachers and students discern the correct result, and a photo of a demonstration.},

Il suo eventuale scioglimento porterebbe a una diminuzione del volume d'acqua spostato a cui, però, si aggiungerebbe l'acqua del ghiaccio fuso, per cui il livello dell'acqua dei mari non subirebbe nel complesso variazioni, come accade per un cubetto di ghiaccio in un bicchiere d'acqua.

	abstract = {The ALICE experiment at CERN has planned an upgrade of the Inner Tracking System (ITS), named ITS3, for the LHC Long Shutdown 3, in 2025. The cornerstone of the upgrade is a new CMOS pixel sensor built in 65 nm technology and in bent-cylindrical configuration, replacing the inner layers of the existing detector, the ITS2. The ITS3 will reach much better tracking and vertexing performance, thanks to the improved spatial resolution and the much reduced material budget with respect to the previous Inner Tracking System. 
The aim of this thesis is to report on the analysis of the data collected at beam tests on new ALPIDE chips (used for ITS2, based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor, MAPS) which have been bent in a cylindrical configuration as foreseen for the ITS3. This is the first bending proof of concept for a silicon detector.
In particular, data from beam test taken in 2020 have been studied through a data analysis framework that I have personally written to accomplish this task; the complexity of the data analysis is driven by the fact that each ALPIDE chip has a total of 1024x512 pixel MAPS and by the bent geometry of the sensor.
In this thesis, the promising performances obtained by studying the sensor total efficiency and spatial resolution in different experimental configurations will be presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Negli ultimi anni diversi report europei hanno messo in evidenza come in Europa ci sia bisogno di attrarre pi� giovani allo studio delle discipline scientifiche (STEM ? Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Il problema dell'abbandono degli studi universitari scientifici da parte degli studenti rappresenta un elemento problematico soprattutto in Europa ma anche in Italia.
Lo studio descritto in questa tesi si colloca in attivit� del Piano Lauree Scientifiche del Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia di Bologna, realizzate come continuazione del progetto europeo HOPE - Horizons in Physics Education.
Obiettivo delle attivit� � continuare a monitorare i fattori che spingono gli studenti ad iscriversi a fisica e i motivi di insoddisfazione che possono portare all?abbandono. L?indagine � stata condotta somministrando un questionario a studenti del primo, del secondo e del terzo anno, e realizzando alcune interviste e l?analisi dei dati raccolti.
Oggetto specifico del lavoro qui descritto � stata l?analisi dei dati raccolti e un loro confronto coi risultati di HOPE.
L?indagine condotta conferma quanto � emerso nel progetto HOPE sia per l?indagine sui fattori di interesse, sia per i profili di insoddisfazione.
In particolare � evidente che i principali motivi di interesse sono rappresentati da fattori interni, quali interesse e la curiosit� verso il mondo naturale e l?interesse per l?approccio e i metodi della scienza. Alcuni studenti evidenziano anche una attenzione per la ricaduta sociale della fisica e le sue applicazioni.
Per quanto riguarda i motivi di insoddisfazione emerge che le principali difficolt� sono dovute alla gestione dei ritmi universitari e alla difficolt� di alcuni contenuti trattati. Le difficolt� sono solitamente percepite come personali e gli studenti, pur interessati alla fisica, non sempre si sentono all?altezza di comprenderla fino in fondo.},

However, user interactions based on spatial codes (e.g., displaying codes on phone screens for exchanging contact information) are often tedious, time consuming, and prone to errors due to image corruptions such as noise, blur, saturation, and perspective distortions. We propose Light Codes (LICO), a novel method for fast and fluid exchange of information among users. Light codes are based on transmitting and receiving temporal codes (instead of spatial) using compact and low-cost transceiver devices. The resulting approach enables seamless and near instantaneous exchange of short messages among users with minimal physical and cognitive effort. We design novel coding techniques, hardware prototypes, and applications that are optimized for human-centric communication, and facilitate fast and fluid user-to-user interactions in various challenging conditions, including a range of distances, motion, and ambient illumination. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods both via quantitative analysis and user study based comparisons with several existing approaches including display-camera links, Bluetooth, and near-field communication, which show strong preference toward Light Codes in various real-world application scenarios.},

Our molds, PackMolds, feature neither undercuts nor negative draft angles, facilitating their easy release from thermoformed plastic sheets. In this study, we optimize the geometry of PackMolds to comply with user-speciﬁed draft angle constraints. Instead of simulating the traditional thermoforming process, which necessitates time discretization and specifying detailed parameters for both material properties and machine conﬁguration to achieve an accurate simulation result, we formulate our problem as a constrained geometric optimization problem and solve it using a gradient-based solver. Additionally, in contrast to industrial thermoforming, which beneﬁts from advanced tools, desktop thermoforming lacks such sophisticated resources. Therefore, we introduce a suite of assistive tools to enhance the success of desktop thermoforming. Furthermore, we demonstrate its wide applicability by showcasing its use in not only designing blister packs but also in creating double-sided blister packs and model stands.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the ﬁrst method for synthesizing seasonal transition of terrain textures for an input heightﬁeld. Our method reproduces a seamless transition of terrain textures according to the seasons by learning measured data on the earth using a convolutional neural network. We attribute the main seasonal texture transition to vegetation and snow, and control the texture synthesis not only with the input heightﬁeld but also with the annual temperature and precipitation based on Köppen’s climate classiﬁcation as well as insolation at the location. We found that month-by-month synthesis yields incoherent transitions, while a naïve conditioning with explicit temporal information (e.g., month) degrades generalizability due to the north–south hemisphere difference. To address these issues, we introduce a simple solution—periodic conditioning on the annual data without explicit temporal information. Our experiments reveal that our method can synthesize plausible seasonal transitions of terrain textures. We also demonstrate large-scale texture synthesis by tiling the texture output.},

This unique property makes opal a highly valuable material from the natural science, industry, and humanity perspectives. Opal has a complex internal structure called colloidal polycrystalline, and thus, representations of opal remain unestablished in computer graphics. In this study, to approximate the complex internal structure of opal, we imitate its formation process using the three-dimensional additively weighted Voronoi tessellation and percolation model. Further, we apply path tracing to compute the diffraction patterns of visible light inside opal by utilizing the Ewald construction employed in X-ray diffraction theory. Finally, we achieve a visually plausible output through spectral rendering.},

For increased precision, a vector ﬁeld can adjust particle speed, adaptable for realistic ﬂuid simulations or user-deﬁned control. We address material alteration in 3D terrains with a set of equations applicable across diverse models, requiring only per-particle speciﬁcations for size, density, coefﬁcient of restitution, and sediment capacity.

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray muon radiography has the potential to reveal the density structure of gigantic objects. It utilizes the strong penetration ability of high-energy muons. By measuring the number of muons that travel through a target object, the average density can be calculated along the muon path. Since muons travel in straight paths through matter, specially designed detectors can generate density maps with higher spatial resolution than those obtained with conventional geophysical methods. However, this technique has a few notable limitations in that it can only be applied to near-surface structures above the muon sensor and strongly depends on the characteristics of the local topography. This is due to the fact that almost all cosmic-ray muons arrive only from the upper hemisphere. Geological structures, e.g. volcanoes, that allow for muon detectors to be placed on a slope directly below the point of interest are thus the best candidates for this technique. The drawback of muon radiography that only the horizontally integrated density above the sensor is measured with a time resolution larger than several weeks may be partly remedied by combining its results with gravity data, as they are both sensitive to target density while complementary to each other in several aspects. An example of such a combination is presented: real-time monitoring of magma head height in a volcano conduit.},

	abstract = {We revisit a recent claim that the Earth’s climate system is characterized by sensitive dependence to parameters; in particular, that the system exhibits an asymmetric, large-amplitude response to normally distributed feedback forcing. Such a response would imply irreducible uncertainty in climate change predictions and thus have notable implications for climate science and climate-related policy making. We show that equilibrium climate sensitivity in all generality does not support such an intrinsic indeterminacy; the latter appears only in essentially linear systems. The main ﬂaw in the analysis that led to this claim is inappropriate linearization of an intrinsically nonlinear model; there is no room for physical interpretations or policy conclusions based on this mathematical error. Sensitive dependence nonetheless does exist in the climate system, as well as in climate models – albeit in a very different sense from the one claimed in the linear work under scrutiny – and we illustrate it using a classical energy balance model (EBM) with nonlinear feedbacks. EBMs exhibit two saddle-node bifurcations, more recently called “tipping points,” which give rise to three distinct steady-state climates, two of which are stable. Such bistable behavior is, furthermore, supported by results from more realistic, nonequilibrium climate models. In a truly nonlinear setting, indeterminacy in the size of the response is observed only in the vicinity of tipping points. We show, in fact, that small disturbances cannot result in a large-amplitude response, unless the system is at or near such a point. We discuss brieﬂy how the distance to the bifurcation may be related to the strength of Earth’s ice-albedo feedback.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The granulometric properties and grain size data of fine-grained clastic sediments have been used in many different ways to make paleoenvironmental interpretations. This is particularly true for the eolian environments of arid regions. However, the modern methods of grain size determination that are increasingly available to many people sometimes mislead researchers and suggest that the results of measurements are infallible.\&lt;br\&gt;Here we present findings that are worth considering when using granulometric data. Different chemical pretreatment methods, particle-sizing techniques, and various devices (laser diffraction devices [Fritsch Analysette 22 Microtec Plus, Horiba Partica LA-950 v2 and Malvern Mastersizer 3000], and an automated image analyser [Malvern Morphologi G3-IDSE]) were applied to measure the grain size of aeolian dust deposits and soils and to quantify the effects of different approaches on particle size data.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;br\&gt;(1) Grain: What does it mean grain? Single grain? Aggregated particles? Coated particles? Pretreatment techniques have a significant impact on clumped particles, aggregates, and single grain granulometric parameters. According to our findings, different widely used chemical treatments have substantial and significantly different effects on the results. The purpose of studies determines the required pretreatments (e.g. particles could have been supplied as silt-sized aggregates; then it is not very useful to decompose them to reconstruct past wind flow mechanisms or post-depositional alterations, but from a geotechnical point of view, the situation is different). Our results on particle size modification effects of five widely applied chemical pretreatment procedures demonstrate the importance of pre-measurement handling of samples.\&lt;br\&gt;(2) Size: What is the size of an irregularly shaped particle? Mineral particles are not spheres; their size can only be estimated by applying equivalent diameters. Irregular particle shapes also have an effect on sizing. Automated image analysis provides a wide-scale of shape parameters, which can be used as a novel approach for granulometric characterisation, transport mechanism reconstruction and offers an opportunity to develop granulometric alteration indices.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;br\&gt;(3) Measurement: Particle size differences can also result from measurement technique differences. Direct (image analysis) and indirect (laser scattering) measurement techniques require different prior information about the mineral material to be measured. At a starting point of laser scattering measurements, it is assumed that the analysed particles are spherical, and their complex refractive index is known. In fact, due to the shape anisotropy and mineralogical heterogeneity of particles, fulfilling these requirements is impossible in the case of sedimentary samples and soils. However, even similar approaches (e.g. laser scattering devices of different manufacturers) can provide significantly different size results applying the same optical settings. Grain size distributions were calculated using both the Fraunhofer and Mie scattering theories and a wide variety of optical settings. The unknown 3rd-dimensional size (thickness) of mineral particles is the key source of the uncertainties during image analysis.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;br\&gt;Support of the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (Hungary) under contract NKFIH FK138692 is gratefully acknowledged.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {Glaciers, ice sheets and ice caps represent tectonic systems driven by gravity. Their movement can be studied in real time and the rheological properties and strength of ice determined from laboratory experiments and ﬁeld measurements. All glacial ice has primary stratiﬁcation, exhibited by variations in grain size, bubble content and debris content. As it deforms, with deformation dominated by plastic ﬂow and recrystallization, accompanied locally by fracture under tension, a suite of structures develops that reﬂects the primary fabric of the ice and the anisotropy that develops as a result of cumulative deformation. Initial variations in solid impurity content and strain dependent anisotropy as a result of a crystallographic fabric give rise to effective viscosity increases or decreases compared to isotropic polycrystalline ice of about a factor of ten. Foliation develops from inherited (mostly stratiﬁcation) or introduced (mostly ice veins or fracture traces) fabric elements and from dynamic recrystallization. It is largely dependent on the accumulated strain, which is highest at the base and near the margins of glaciers, ice sheets and ice streams. Folds develop largely passively due to initial ampliﬁcation of irregularities in the primary stratiﬁcation, to variations in ﬂow with time or to inhomogeneous ﬂow associated with shear zones and ductile accommodation around open fractures. Buckle folds and boudinage, mostly on a small scale, occur where viscosity contrast is large, mostly in basal ice. Thrusting and wrench faulting are documented in surging glaciers but theoretically most unlikely and rare or absent elsewhere. Many structures interpreted as faults are not due to shear failure but rather result from shear displacements during opening and closing of tensile fractures.},

L’intento dell’iniziativa non è quello dell’autocelebrazione di una fase che è stata indubbiamente molto positiva nella vita plurisecolare del nostro ateneo, ma di porre in evidenza gli esiti che ha conseguito la sua ricerca sul piano nazionale e internazionale; le reti scientifiche che intorno a queste attività sono nate e si sono sviluppate; l’attività formativa che ne è seguita; i rapporti con le imprese, le amministrazioni pubbliche e altri comparti della vita civile cittadina e regionale. Questa ricognizione, che non è solo di memoria, si propone anche l’obiettivo di segnalare i possibili livelli di crescita e di intersezione tra le frontiere della scienza e della tecnologia e le esigenze della vita poiché la ricerca e la formazione sono chiamate a svolgere compiti molto rilevanti nella società della conoscenza.},

Hoffman raccontava nel 2004 di aver assistito a una conferenza di Emiliani a Miami nel 1967 su una singola specie di foraminifero il cui guscio si avvolge a sinistra quando è freddo e a destra quando è caldo – proprio come la politica americana – notava ironico (si trattava quasi certamente di Neogloboquadrina pachiderma). Ma ciò che lo colpì maggiormente fu l’oratore italiano “ad alto voltaggio e veloce eloquio”, la cui presentazione era così convinta e convincente da spingerlo per anni a pronunciare i nomi linneani delle specie con lo stesso enfatico accento bolognese in suo onore.” (Vai, 2020, p. 73)
Sicurezza mal riposta?: “Viene così dimostrato che i fattori principali di controllo delle variazioni climatiche sono i parametri astronomici della Terra (eccentricità dell’orbita, obliquità e precessione dell’asse), che regolano le fluttuazioni della curva dell’insolazione.” (Vai, 2020, p. 75)
Critica al termine antropocene: “Si noti anche l’assoluta ortodossia stratigrafica del geologo Emiliani, a paragone delle fantasie eretiche del cosiddetto Antropocene già serpeggianti fra biologi e chimici, in quel caso poco avvezzi al rigore procedurale e alla stabilità degli standard scientifici.” (Vai, 2020, p. 78)
“Oratore brillante e polemista di razza (ritengo per qualche ascendenza romagnola), ha conservato nel tratto l’eleganza e la bonomia del petroniano classico (non a caso ha sempre mantenuto la doppia cittadinanza).” (Vai, 2020, p. 79)

Drawing geology in the field furthermore facilitates observation and maximizes the value of fieldwork. Every geologist, whether a student, academic, professional, or amateur enthusiast, will benefit from the ability to draw geological features accurately. This book describes how and what to draw in geology. Essential drawing techniques, together with practical advice in creating high quality diagrams, are described the opening chapters. How to draw different types of geology, including faults, folds, metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, and fossils, are the subjects of separate chapters, and include descriptions of what are the important features to draw and describe. Different types of sketch, such as drawings of three-dimensional outcrops, landscapes, thin-sections, and hand-specimens of rocks, crystals, and minerals, are discussed. The methods used to create technical diagrams such as geological maps and cross-sections are also covered. Finally, modern techniques in the acquisition and recording of field data, including photogrammetry and aerial surveys, and digital methods of illustration, are the subject of the final chapter of the book. Throughout, worked examples of field sketches and illustrations are provided as well as descriptions of the common mistakes to be avoided.},
