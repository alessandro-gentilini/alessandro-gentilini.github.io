# Watershed and border between Austria and Italy
Does the border between Austria (Sillian) and Italy (San Candido/Innichen) follow the watershed?

According to the data available from https://www.hydrosheds.org/ the border does not follow the watershed.
San Candido/Innichen and Sesto/Sexten are in the drain basin of the Danube while Dobbiaco/Toblach is in the drain basin of the Piave.
