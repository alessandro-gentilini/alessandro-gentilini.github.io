# Exercises in Bayesian statistics

##  Rasmus B책책th's beach party
An [example](rasmus_baath_lake_beach_summer_party.R) inspired by the excellent course [Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/fundamentals-of-bayesian-data-analysis-in-r) by Rasmus B책책th.

## Albert Tarantola's Estimation of the Epicentral Coordinates of a Seismic Event
[Problem 7.1](Estimation_of_the_Epicentral_Coordinates_of_a_Seismic_Event.R) in the book TARANTOLA, Albert. [*Inverse problem theory and methods for model parameter estimation*](http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/Books/InverseProblemTheory.pdf). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2005.

## A bayesian approach to the confidence bounds when sampling from small finite universes
We have a population of N=100 elements, some of the elements have a property of interest.
We take a random sample of n=10 elements from the population and we find a=1 element with 
the property of interest: what can be said about the number of elements in the population
with the property of interest?

question with a simple and exact answer that is easy
to provide?*
