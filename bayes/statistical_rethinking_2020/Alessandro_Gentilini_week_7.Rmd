There are only two problems this week, because the models take a little while to run.
Be sure to run the models from the relevant part of Chapter 12 first. That will give
you almost all of the model structure you need.

**1.** In the Trolley data—data(Trolley)—we saw how education level (modeled as
an ordered category) is associated with responses. Is this association causal? One
plausible confound is that education is also associated with age, through a causal
process: People are older when they finish school than when they begin it.
Reconsider the Trolley data in this light. 
Draw a DAG that represents hypothetical causal relationships 
among response, education, and age.
Which statical model or models do you need to evaluate the causal influence 
of education on responses?
Fit these models to the trolley data. What do you conclude about the causal 
relationships among these three variables?

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
setwd('~/projects/alessandro-gentilini.github.io/bayes/statistical_rethinking_2020/')
```

```{r}
## R code 12.30
library(rethinking)
data(Trolley)
d <- Trolley
levels(d$edu)

## R code 12.31
edu_levels <- c( 6 , 1 , 8 , 4 , 7 , 2 , 5 , 3 )
d$edu_new <- edu_levels[ d$edu ]

## R code 12.32
library(gtools)
set.seed(1805)
delta <- rdirichlet( 10 , alpha=rep(2,7) )
str(delta)

## R code 12.33
h <- 3
plot( NULL , xlim=c(1,7) , ylim=c(0,0.4) , xlab="index" , ylab="probability" )
for ( i in 1:nrow(delta) ) lines( 1:7 , delta[i,] , type="b" ,
    pch=ifelse(i==h,16,1) , lwd=ifelse(i==h,4,1.5) ,
    col=ifelse(i==h,"black",col.alpha("black",0.7)) )

# ## R code 12.34
 dat <- list(
     R = d$response ,
     action = d$action,
     intention = d$intention,
     contact = d$contact,
     E = as.integer( d$edu_new ),   # edu_new as an index
     alpha = rep( 2 , 7 ) )      # delta prior

 m12.6 <- ulam(
     alist(
         R ~ ordered_logistic( phi , kappa ),
         phi <- bE*sum( delta_j[1:E] ) + bA*action + bI*intention + bC*contact,
         kappa ~ normal( 0 , 1.5 ),
         c(bA,bI,bC,bE) ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),
         vector[8]: delta_j <<- append_row( 0 , delta ),
         simplex[7]: delta ~ dirichlet( alpha )
     ), data=dat , chains=4 , cores=4 )

# ## R code 12.35
precis( m12.6 , depth=2 , omit="kappa" )

# ## R code 12.36
delta_labels <- c("Elem","MidSch","SHS","HSG","SCol","Bach","Mast","Grad")
pairs( m12.6 , pars="delta" , labels=delta_labels )
```

I add `age` to the model as an ordinary continuous variable:

```{r}
 dat2 <- list(
     R = d$response ,
     action = d$action,
     intention = d$intention,
     contact = d$contact,
     E = as.integer( d$edu_new ),   # edu_new as an index
     age=d$age,
     alpha = rep( 2 , 7 ) )      # delta prior

 m12.6_2 <- ulam(
     alist(
         R ~ ordered_logistic( phi , kappa ),
         phi <- bE*sum( delta_j[1:E] )+ bAge*age + bA*action + bI*intention + bC*contact,
         kappa ~ normal( 0 , 1.5 ),
         c(bA,bI,bC,bE,bAge) ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),
         vector[8]: delta_j <<- append_row( 0 , delta ),
         simplex[7]: delta ~ dirichlet( alpha )
     ), data=dat2 , chains=4 , cores=4 )

# ## R code 12.35
precis( m12.6_2 , depth=2 , omit="kappa" )

# ## R code 12.36
delta_labels <- c("Elem","MidSch","SHS","HSG","SCol","Bach","Mast","Grad")
pairs( m12.6_2 , pars="delta" , labels=delta_labels )
```

Age seems to be not influential, but after adding it to the model, the overall
association of education `bE` is now positive; I cannot explain this result.

***

**2.** Consider one more variable in the Trolley data: Gender. Suppose that gender
might influence education as well as response directly. Draw the DAG now that
includes response, education, age, and gender.
Using only the DAG, is it possible that the inferences from Problem 1 are confounded 
by gender? If so, define any additional models you need to infer the causal
influence of education on response. What do you conclude?

I would say that it is possible that the inferences from Problem 1 are confounded 
by gender, but I have not a logical exaplanation to that since I did not still fully grasped
the causal inference and the DAGs.

I will add an index variable `sex` and then education `bE` and age `bAge` 
coefficients will get indexed by `sex`.

```{r}
d$sex <- ifelse(d$male==1,2,1)
dat3 <- list(
    R = d$response ,
    sex = d$sex,
    action = d$action,
    intention = d$intention,
    contact = d$contact,
    E = as.integer( d$edu_new ),   # edu_new as an index
    age=d$age,
    alpha = rep( 2 , 7 ) )      # delta prior

m12.6_3 <- ulam(
    alist(
        R ~ ordered_logistic( phi , kappa ),
        phi <- bE[sex]*sum( delta_j[1:E] )+ bAge[sex]*age + bA*action + bI*intention + bC*contact,
        bE[sex] ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),
        bAge[sex] ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),
        kappa ~ normal( 0 , 1.5 ),
        c(bA,bI,bC) ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),
        vector[8]: delta_j <<- append_row( 0 , delta ),
        simplex[7]: delta ~ dirichlet( alpha )
    ), data=dat3 , chains=4 , cores=4 )

## R code 12.35
precis( m12.6_3 , depth=2 , omit="kappa" )
```

Age is still not influential and now there is a positive association of education
for men and a negative association of education for women.
