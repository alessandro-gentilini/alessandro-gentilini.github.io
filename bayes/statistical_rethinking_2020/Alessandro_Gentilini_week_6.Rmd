**1.** The data in data(NWOGrants) are outcomes for scientific funding applications
for the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) from 2010–2012
(see van der Lee and Ellemers doi:10.1073/pnas.1510159112). These data have a
very similar structure to the UCBAdmit data discussed in Chapter 11.
I want you to consider a similar question: What are the total and indirect causal
effects of gender on grant awards? Consider a mediation path (a pipe) through
discipline. Draw the corresponding DAG and then use one or more binomial
GLMs to answer the question.
What is your causal interpretation? If NWO’s goal is to equalize rates of funding
between the genders, what type of intervention would be most effective?

***

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
setwd('~/projects/alessandro-gentilini.github.io/bayes/statistical_rethinking_2020/')
```

```{r}
library(rethinking)
data(NWOGrants)
d<-NWOGrants
d
```

```{r}
library(dagitty)
dag <- dagitty( "dag {
    G -> D
    D -> A
}")
coordinates(dag) <- list(
    x=c(G=-1, D=0, A=1),
    y=c(G=0, D=0, A=0)
)
drawdag(dag)
adjustmentSets( dag, exposure="G" , outcome="A" )
```

For the above DAG, as `dagitty.net/dags.html` says *No adjustment is necessary to estimate the total effect of G on A.*
So for the total effect the following model is fine:

```{r}
## R code 11.29
dat_list <- list(
    admit = d$awards,
    applications = d$applications,
    gid = ifelse( d$gender=="m" , 1 , 2 )
)
m11.7 <- ulam(
    alist(
        admit ~ dbinom( applications , p ) ,
        logit(p) <- a[gid] ,
        a[gid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 1.5 )
    ) , data=dat_list , chains=4 )
precis( m11.7 , depth=2 )
```

```{r}
## R code 11.30
post <- extract.samples(m11.7)
diff_a <- post$a[,1] - post$a[,2]
diff_p <- inv_logit(post$a[,1]) - inv_logit(post$a[,2])
precis(list( diff_a=diff_a , diff_p=diff_p ), hist=FALSE)

## R code 11.31
postcheck( m11.7 )
# draw lines connecting points from same dept
labels <- abbreviate(d$discipline)
for ( i in 1:9 ) {
    x <- 1 + 2*(i-1)
    y1 <- d$awards[x]/d$applications[x]
    y2 <- d$awards[x+1]/d$applications[x+1]
    lines( c(x,x+1) , c(y1,y2) , col=rangi2 , lwd=2 )
    text( x+0.5 , (y1+y2)/2 + 0.05 , labels[x] , cex=0.8 , col=rangi2 )
}
```

So the total effect is that: probability difference between male (1) and female (2) is between 0.6%  and 5%, so positive,
so male advantage.

Instead, the *Minimal sufficient adjustment sets for estimating the direct effect of G on A:* 
is the set with just one element: D; so the following model adjusts for D:

```{r}
## R code 11.32
dat_list$dept_id <- rep(1:9,each=2)
m11.8 <- ulam(
    alist(
        admit ~ dbinom( applications , p ) ,
        logit(p) <- a[gid] + delta[dept_id] ,
        a[gid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 1.5 ) ,
        delta[dept_id] ~ dnorm( 0 , 1.5 )
    ) , data=dat_list , chains=4 , iter=4000 )
precis( m11.8 , depth=2, hist=FALSE )

## R code 11.33
post <- extract.samples(m11.8)
diff_a <- post$a[,1] - post$a[,2]
diff_p <- inv_logit(post$a[,1]) - inv_logit(post$a[,2])
precis( list( diff_a=diff_a , diff_p=diff_p ), hist=FALSE )

## R code 11.34
pg <- with( dat_list , sapply( 1:9 , function(k)
    applications[dept_id==k]/sum(applications[dept_id==k]) ) )
rownames(pg) <- c("male","female")
colnames(pg) <- abbreviate(unique(d$discipline))
round( pg , 2 )
```



```{r}
chem<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,1])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,1])
physical<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,2])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,2])
phys<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,3])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,3])
hum<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,4])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,4])
tech<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,5])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,5])
inter<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,6])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,6])
earth<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,7])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,7])
soc<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,8])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,8])
med<-inv_logit(post$a[,1]+post$delta[,9])-inv_logit(post$a[,2]+post$delta[,9])

diff_in_prob<-data.frame(
    chem=chem,physical=physical,phys=phys,hum=hum,
    tech=tech,inter=inter,earth=earth,soc=soc,med=med
)

precis(diff_in_prob,digits=2,hist=FALSE)
boxplot(diff_in_prob,main='Difference in prob. of award between men and women, within disciplines',
ylab='difference in probability')
```

There is a slightly advantage for men: on average it is about 2.5%, so the most effective
intervention is the following: when you have to choose between a man grant and a woman
grant that have the same value then pick a random number $n$ between $0$ and $1$ and give the award to
the woman if $n<0.525$.

***

**2.** Suppose that the NWO Grants sample has an unobserved confound that influ-
ences both choice of discipline and the probability of an award. One example of
such a confound could be the career stage of each applicant. Suppose that in some
disciplines, junior scholars apply for most of the grants. In other disciplines, schol-
ars from all career stages compete. As a result, career stage influences discipline as
well as the probability of being awarded a grant.
Add these influences to your DAG from Problem 1. What happens now when you
condition on discipline? Does it provide an un-confounded estimate of the direct
path from gender to an award? Why or why not? Justify your answer with the
back-door criterion. Hint: This is structurally a lot like the grandparents-parents-
children-neighborhoods example from a previous week.
If you have trouble thinking this though, try simulating fake data, assuming your
DAG is true. Then analyze it using the model from Problem 1. What do you con-
clude? Is it possible for gender to have a real direct causal influence but for a regres-
sion conditioning on both gender and discipline to suggest zero influence?

***

Using `dagitty.net/dags.html`, if Career Stage can be observed then:

1. No adjustment is necessary to estimate the **total** effect of G on A.

2. The Minimal sufficient adjustment sets for estimating the **direct** effect of G on A
 is the set {Career Stage, D}; adjusting just for the Career Stage is fine (white node
 is adjusted) while adjusting just for the discipline introduces a biasing path.
 Adjusting for both D and Career Stage is fine.

![Adjusting just for career is fine.](./week6_adjust_just_for_career.png)

![Biasing path (in magenta) appears when adjusting just for Discipline.](./week_6_biasing_path.png)

![Adjusting for both does not introduce a biasing path.](week6_adjust_both_career_and_discipline.png)

**3.** The data contained in library(MASS);data(eagles) are records of salmon
pirating attempts by Bald Eagles in Washington State. See ?eagles for details.
While one eagle feeds, sometimes another will swoop in and try to steal the salmon
from it. Call the feeding eagle the “victim” and the thief the “pirate.” Use the avail-
able data to build one or more binomial GLMs of successful pirating attempts, using
size and age as predictors. Consider any relevant interactions.
