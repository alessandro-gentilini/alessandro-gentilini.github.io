**1.** Consider three fictional Polynesian islands. On each there is a Royal Ornithologist charged by the king with surveying the birb population. They
have each found the following proportions of 5 important birb species:

              Birb A   Birb B   Birb C   Birb D   Birb E
    Island 1    0.2      0.2      0.2     0.2      0.2
    Island 2    0.8      0.1      0.05    0.025    0.025
    Island 3    0.05     0.15     0.7     0.05     0.05

Notice that each row sums to 1, all the birbs. This problem has two parts. It
is not computationally complicated. But it is conceptually tricky.
First, compute the entropy of each island’s birb distribution. Interpret
these entropy values.
Second, use each island’s birb distribution to predict the other two. This
means to compute the K-L Divergence of each island from the others, treating each island as if it were a statistical model of the other islands. You should
end up with 6 different K-L Divergence values. Which island predicts the
others best? Why?

***

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
setwd('~/projects/alessandro-gentilini.github.io/bayes/statistical_rethinking_2020/')
```

```{r}
d <- matrix(c(.2,.2,.2,.2,.2,
.8,.1,.05,.025,.025,
.05,.15,.7,.05,.05)
,nrow=3,ncol=5,byrow=TRUE)
d
```

```{r}
H <- function (p)
{
    return(-sum(p*log(p)))
}
```
Each rows has the proportions and that's mean that they
can be thought as frequencies and so probabilities.

```{r}
H(d[1,])
H(d[2,])
H(d[3,])
```

Since in Island 1 the five birds are equally distributed 
we have that the entropy for the first island is the highest
because we are quite uncertain about what bird we will see
when we arrive for the first time on the Island 1.
Island 2 has the lowest entropy because I would bet the first
bird I will see is a Birb A since its proportion is quite
high, namely 80%.

```{r}
D_KL <- function(p,q)
{
    return(sum(p*(log(p)-log(q))))
}
```

Prior to compute the divergences I would say that Island 1 will
be the best predictor because it has the five species
equally distributed and so no surprise will appears when we
will see a lot of Birb A on Island 2 or a lot of Birb C on
island 3. 
On the other hand Island 2 will perform bad with respect to
Island 3 because Birb A are rare on Island 3 and
very common on Island 2.
Island 3 will perform bad with respect to
Island 2 because Birb C are very common on Island 3 and
rare on Island 2.

Use Island 1 to predict 2 and 3:
```{r}
D_KL(d[2,],d[1,])
D_KL(d[3,],d[1,])
```

Use Island 2 to predict 1 and 3:
```{r}
D_KL(d[1,],d[2,])
D_KL(d[3,],d[2,])
```

Use Island 3 to predict 1 and 2:
```{r}
D_KL(d[1,],d[3,])
D_KL(d[2,],d[3,])
```

Actually both the divergences associated with Island 1 are the lowest ones.


**2.** Recall the marriage, age, and happiness collider bias example from Chapter 6. Run models m6.9 and m6.10 again. Compare these two models using
WAIC (or LOO, they will produce identical results). Which model is expected to make better predictions? Which model provides the correct causal
inference about the influence of age on happiness? Can you explain why the
answers to these two questions disagree?

***

```{r}
## R code 6.21
library(rethinking)
d <- sim_happiness( seed=1977 , N_years=1000 )


## R code 6.22
d2 <- d[ d$age>17 , ] # only adults
d2$A <- ( d2$age - 18 ) / ( 65 - 18 )

## R code 6.23
d2$mid <- d2$married + 1
m6.9 <- quap(
    alist(
        happiness ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),
        mu <- a[mid] + bA*A,
        a[mid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ),
        bA ~ dnorm( 0 , 2 ),
        sigma ~ dexp(1)
    ) , data=d2 )
m6.9

## R code 6.24
m6.10 <- quap(
    alist(
        happiness ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),
        mu <- a + bA*A,
        a ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ),
        bA ~ dnorm( 0 , 2 ),
        sigma ~ dexp(1)
    ) , data=d2 )
m6.10
```

```{r}
WAIC(m6.9)
WAIC(m6.10)
compare(m6.9,m6.10,func=WAIC)
```

**3.** Reconsider the urban fox analysis from last week’s homework. Use WAIC
or LOO based model comparison on five different models, each using weight
as the outcome, and containing these sets of predictor variables:

    (1) avgfood + groupsize + area
    (2) avgfood + groupsize
    (3) groupsize + area
    (4) avgfood
    (5) area

Can you explain the relative differences in WAIC scores, using the fox DAG
from last week’s homework? Be sure to pay attention to the standard error
of the score differences (dSE).
