{\quoteformat{Landscape photography is the supreme proof of the photographer, 
and often his supreme disappointment.}

{\quoteformat{I made the arrowheads longer and stronger,
so that they will not disappear so easily on xerox copies.}
\author DONALD E. KNUTH (199?)
}

{\quoteformat{I had become thoroughly hooked on the subject
--constantly aware that I was supposed to be doing other things, 
yet unable to resist mathematical beauty.}
\author DONALD E. KNUTH (199?)
}

{\quoteformat{Image analysts have a long educational battle to fight 
in the radiological setting in order to bring the message 
that 3D datasets acquired with anisotropies larger than [1 : 2] 
are simply dismissive of the most fundamental concept of 
digital signal processing: The Shannon Sampling Theorem.}
\author ITK (199?)
}

{\quoteformat{We want to have some theoretical basis for what we're doing. 
We don't want a frivolous or sloppy or second-rate algorithm. 
We don't want some other algorithmist to say, ``You guys are morons''.}
\author ANDREI BRODER (2019)

{\quoteformat{Computer programming is an art, 
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, 
because it requires skill and ingenuity, 
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.}
\author DONALD E KNUTH (1974)
}

{\quoteformat{Thus, for example, Donald Knuth took Chomskyâ€™s book
on structural linguistics with him on his honeymoon. 
In spite of this Don is still married to Jill, 45 years later: 
when you have dinner with the Knuths you talk more about quilting 
and printing Lutheran bibles than programming, 
but it all seems of a piece.}
\author GRAHAM NELSON (2018)

{\quoteformat{$\ldots$ a function of royal blood in the family of entire functions, 
whose distinguished properties separate it 
from its bourgeois brethren}

{\quoteformat{Aut inveniam viam 
aut faciam}
\author HANNIBAL (218 a.C.n.)
}

\medskip

{\quoteformat{
By avoiding detailed proofs and analysis, the book will appeal
to those who wish to enrich their problem-solving arsenal. 
The book is ideal for people who do not have a very deep 
academic background in mathematics, and yet wish to use 
mathematics for work or research.}
\author DANIEL COHEN-OR (20??)

{\quoteformat{
We dedicate this book
To our fellow citizens
Who, for love of truth,
Take from thei own wants
By taxes and gifts,
And now and then send forth
One of themselves
As dedicated servant,
To forward the search
In to the mysteries and marvelous simplicities
Of this strange and beautiful Universe,
Our home.}
\author CHARLES W. MISNER, KIP S. THORNE, JOHN ARCHIBALD WHEELER (19??)

{\quoteformat{
For many years the theory of automata was developing rapidly
and solving problems that were ostensibly related to computers; 
but real programmers could not care less about those theorems 
because Turing machines were so different from real machines.}
\author DONALD E. KNUTH (1971)
}

\medskip

{\quoteformat{
If we make an unbiased examination of the accomplishments
made by mathematicians to the real world of computer programming, 
we are forced to conclude that, so far, 
the theory has actually done more harm than good.}
\author DONALD E. KNUTH (1971)

{\quoteformat{
Always be the worst guy in every band you're in.}
\author PAT METHENY (19??)
}

\medskip

{\quoteformat{
The final algorithm of concern to us in this section is long division, 
in which we want to divide $(m+n)$-place integers by $n$-place integers.
Here the ordinary pencil-and-paper method involves a certain amount of 
guesswork and ingenuity on the part of the person doing the division; 
we must either eliminate this guesswork from the algorithm or 
develop some theory to explain it more carefully.}
\author DONALD E. KNUTH (19??)

{\quoteformat{
If we were to wait for convergence proofs and error estimates 
for the new methods, most of the computers now in use in technology and industry 
would come grinding to a halt.}
